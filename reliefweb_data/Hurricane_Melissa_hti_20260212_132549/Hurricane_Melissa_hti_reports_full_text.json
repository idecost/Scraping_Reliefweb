      "pdf_text": "HAITI: Tropical Storm Melissa\nFLASH UPDATE N0.1 – as of 23 October 2025\nThis report is produced with the support of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\nAffairs (OCHA), in collaboration with humanitarian partners and based on available information.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n● Tropical Storm Melissa continues to\nmove slowly toward Haiti’s southern\ncoast, according to the National\nHurricane Center (NHC).\n● On 22 October, the Civil Protection\nDirectorate (DGPC) issued an\norange alert for the departments of\nOuest, Grand ’Anse, Nippes, Sud\nand Sud-Est.\n● Sustained rainfall and strong winds\nare expected from Thursday\nevening, with potential flooding,\nlandslides, and power outages in\ncoastal and mountainous areas.\n● The CERF Anticipatory Action\nFramework has been activated. A\ntotal of US$4 million has been\nallocated to WFP, UNICEF and IOM\nto enable the launch of early actions\naimed at reducing the impact of the\nshock on vulnerable populations.\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\nAs of 23 October at 9:00 a.m., the United States National Hurricane Center reported that the center of\nTropical Storm Melissa was located approximately 485 km southwest of Port-au-Prince. The storm is\nmoving west-northwest at nearly 6 km/h, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 185 km from the\ncenter. Melissa is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane by the end of the weekend or early next\nweek.\nThe storm is forecast to bring heavy rainfall to parts of southern Haiti throughout the weekend and into\nnext week, leading to significant and life-threatening flash floods, as well as multiple landslides. Strong\nwinds could also affect the Tiburon Peninsula for a day or more.\nOn 22 October, the Civil Protection Directorate (DGPC) issued an orange alert for the departments of\nOuest, Grand’Anse, Nippes, Sud and Sud-Est, urging the population to remain vigilant due to the risks of\nheavy rainfall and strong winds. DGPC recommends that the population stay informed through official\nadvisories, avoid high-risk areas (including ravines, riverbanks, coastal zones, flood-prone and landslide-\nprone areas), refrain from crossing swollen rivers, secure roofs and loose objects, and prepare an\nemergency kit and shelter plan as needed.\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to\nCoordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.\nWe advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\nwww.unocha.org\n\nHaïti Situation Report No. 1\nHUMANITARIAN NEEDS\nThe expected heavy rainfall could further exacerbate the vulnerability of communities already affected by\nfood insecurity and internal displacement. Humanitarian partners have identified immediate needs for\nemergency shelter, access to safe drinking water, sanitation, food assistance, and protection measures for\nhouseholds living in areas at high risk of flooding and landslides.\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\nHumanitarian interventions are focusing on the departments placed under orange alert by the Civil\nProtection Directorate (DGPC) and the Hydrometeorological Unit (UHM), namely Grand’Anse, Sud,\nNippes, Sud-Est and Ouest.\nCash Assistance\nUNICEF is collaborating with WFP to provide cash assistance to approximately 8,000 vulnerable\nhouseholds in the departments of Sud, Grand’Anse, Nippes and Sud-Est. This joint intervention aims to\nensure a coordinated response, avoid duplication, and expand coverage to at-risk families ahead of\npotential impact. In addition, IOM is working with UNICEF and WFP to provide cash assistance to 3,000\nvulnerable households in areas exposed to the storm.\nFood Security\nFood for the Poor maintains a stock of 20 metric tons of rice in each of its regional warehouses in Jacmel,\nAnse-à-Veau, Jérémie and Caracol, to support potential food assistance needs in an emergency.\nNutrition\nUNICEF has pre-positioned nutritional supplies in the four most exposed departments: Sud, Sud-Est,\nNippes and Grand’Anse. Additional stocks are available in more than 100 health facilities across the Sud,\nSud-Est and Grand’Anse departments to ensure continuity of essential nutrition services if access\nbecomes disrupted.\nProtection\nExisting partnerships support vulnerable households across the southern region. UNICEF is working with\nHEKS-EPER in Grand’Anse, ACCODEP in Sud, and Plan Haiti in Sud-Est. UNICEF’s Protection section is\nalso collaborating with AVSI to monitor cash assistance and provide support to vulnerable families.\nRisk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)\nAwareness messages are currently being disseminated through SMS and automated phone calls, in\ncoordination with UNICEF, IOM, WFP, OCHA and DGPC, notably via the U-Report platform, to inform and\nprepare communities ahead of the storm. As part of these efforts, IOM is providing targeted support for\nautomated voice messaging in Île-à-Vache, Les Cayes, Port-Salut, Torbeck and Saint-Louis-du-Sud.\nShelter and Non-Food Items (NFI)\nApproximately 150 DGPC volunteers have been mobilized to prepare over 100 temporary evacuation\nshelters to accommodate people living in high-risk areas, if needed. Preparations include opening,\ncleaning, minor repairs, installation of essential equipment, and setting up shelter operations.\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nwww.unocha.org\n\nHaïti Situation Report No. 1\nThese shelters are located in the departments of Sud, Grand’Anse, Nippes and Sud-Est, as well as in the\nOuest department, particularly in Léogâne, Grand-Goâve and Petit-Goâve. These activities are being\ncarried out jointly by DGPC and IOM as part of the activation of the Anticipatory Action mechanism.\nIn parallel, IOM is preparing to scale up its response efforts. Essential relief items have been pre-\npositioned to support affected families. In total, IOM has pre-positioned NFI kits for more than 10,000\nhouseholds and shelter kits for over 30,000 households across the country. In the Sud department,\nnotably in Camp-Perrin and Jérémie, IOM already has NFI supplies for 3,000 households and shelter kits\nfor 2,500 households.\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)\nUNICEF has pre-positioned 2,900 hygiene kits in the Sud department, covering approximately 14,500\npeople. Operational coordination is ongoing with IOM, which also has shelter and NFI kits available to\nensure a joint and complementary response in the event of impact.\nCoordination\nBased on NOAA forecasts, the CERF Anticipatory Action Framework for tropical storms and hurricanes in\nHaiti was triggered: the readiness threshold was activated on 21 October at 11:00 EST, followed by full\nactivation on 22 October at 5:00 EST. The activation aims to reduce the humanitarian impact of this\npredictable shock by enabling early action, based on forecasting models and risk analysis.\nFollowing the activation of the Anticipatory Action Framework, OCHA mobilized members of the AA group,\nincluding UN agencies, the Haitian Red Cross and NGOs, to ensure enhanced coordination of anticipatory\nactions. In parallel, the Sud inter-sectoral group convened to assess preparedness levels and partner\npositioning in view of a potential response.\nAt a strategic level, a DGPC–UN coordination forum has been established to ensure daily monitoring of\nanticipatory actions and post-impact response. The group held its first meeting on 22 October 2025.\nAlthough the National and Departmental Emergency Operations Centers (COUs) are not yet fully\nactivated, humanitarian actors remain fully mobilized to support civil protection authorities and provide a\nrapid and coordinated response through existing coordination mechanisms.\nIn addition, OCHA is supporting DGPC in updating and reinforcing contingency stocks to strengthen\nnational response capacity.\nAs of 22 October 2025, the 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP) is only 14.5% funded.\nThe ongoing hurricane season, combined with low emergency stock levels and limited funding,\nsignificantly increases the risk of a large-scale humanitarian crisis.\nA new Flash Update will be issued later this week.\nContacts:\nClaire-Emmanuelle Pressoir, Public Information Officer, OCHA : Claire.pressoir@un.org\nModibo Traoré, Head of Office, OCHA : traorem@un.org\nFor more informations www.unocha.org, www.reliefweb.int, https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/haiti\nHumanitarian news is also available on our WhatsApp channel :\nhttps://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va9ta4865yDKzOB9wI37\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nwww.unocha.org",

      "pdf_text": "Haiti\nTropical Storm\nMelissa\nFlash Update No. 1\n© UNICEF Haiti/2021/\nReporting Period: 22-24 October 2025\nHighlights\n• Tropical Storm Melissa is moving toward southwest Haiti and\nmay strengthen into a major hurricane by the weekend, bringing\n200–300 mm of rain and severe flooding risks.\n• The Directorate of Civil Protection (DPC) and humanitarian\npartners are fully mobilized; early impacts include flooding,\nlandslides, and one fatality.\n• UNICEF has activated its emergency protocols and\nanticipatory action measures, with health, nutrition, and WASH\nsupplies prepositioned and coordination ongoing to support\naffected families.\n• UNICEF is working with partners and donors to provide cash\nsupport to 8,000 households, ensuring a unified response.\nSituation Update\nTropical Storm *Melissa* (No. 13) continues to move slowly northwest across the Dominican Republic and is expected\nto move across the Southwest of Haiti during the next couple days and intensify into a hurricane and major hurricane\ninto the weekend. The NHC has issued warnings for Haiti over the Tiburon peninsula from the international border to\nPort-au-Prince (PaP). Hurricane-force winds are expected in southwestern Haiti beginning through Friday to Saturday.\nFurther strengthening is expected, and Melissa might turn into a category 4 hurricane by 26 October. Very intense\nrainfall (total of 200-300mm) is expected over through Saturday. Additional heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday.\nSignificant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are expected.\nFlooding, debris and landslides are expected to block key roads and damage power and telecoms, slowing first\nresponders and interrupting services. Ports, airports and water systems in coastal and low-lying areas may be disrupted,\nwith increased risk to health facilities, schools and infrastructure. Marine conditions pose hazards to vessels, while soil\nand crop loss is likely in affected farming zones.\nAccording to the Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC), Haiti’s disaster management system has been fully mobilised,\ncoordinating with national Hydrometeorological authorities and conducting public awareness. Flooding and landslides\nhave been recorded with some injuries, and one fatality caused by a fallen tree. Rapid assessments are under way with\nlocal teams to determine priority needs.\nUNICEF Response\nUNICEF Haiti is closely monitoring the evolution of Tropical Storm Melissa and maintaining regular contacts with sectoral\ncounterparts to ensure timely support to affected children and families. In line with established preparedness\nprocedures, UNICEF has activated its internal monitoring protocols and is maintaining regular communication with key\npartners in education, child protection, WASH, health, nutrition, and social protection to assess immediate and\nsubsequent needs.\nThrough existing partnership agreements with government institutions and NGOs, UNICEF stands ready to mobilize\npre-positioned supplies and technical assistance.\n1\n\nUNICEF is activating its communication in emergency strategy and will continue to disseminate readiness content\nthroughout the event.\nHealth\nMedical supplies have been pre-positioned at SONAPI (Societe National des Parcs Industriels) for rapid deployment by\nMinistry of Public Health & Population, complemented by ongoing coordination with the Emergency Medical Team to\nensure continuity of health services. The Regional Office is also supporting the provision of Acute Watery Diarrhea\n(AWD) and Inter-Agency Emergency Health Kits for primary healthcare facilities, while monitoring the readiness and\nmobilization of medical teams.\nNutrition\nOver 100 health facilities in the South-East, Nippes, and Grand’Anse have been stocked with RUTF, and other nutrition\nsupplies sufficient for one to three months, with final deliveries underway in the South to ensure uninterrupted service.\nThe Nutrition Cluster has also launched a rapid capacity mapping exercise to identify alternative supply routes in flood-\nprone areas, with a first draft map expected on 24 October.\nWASH\nUNICEF has prepositioned 2,900 WASH hygiene kits in the South, covering approximately 14,500 people. Coordination\nis also underway with IOM, which has cleaning kits available on site, to ensure a joint and complementary response.\nHumanitarian Cash transfer\nUnder the cash component, UNICEF will ensure complementarity with WFP. In line with OCHA guidelines, each\nhousehold is to receive US$ 192. As WFP is covering US$ 100, UNICEF will provide an additional US$ 92, thereby\nsupporting approximately 8,000 households in total.\nCommunication with Communities\nMore than 83,000 storm-related prevention awareness messages were disseminated via SMS and WhatsApp, in\ncollaboration with IOM, WFP, OCHA, and DGPC, as well as through the U-Report platform. Coordination efforts are\nunderway to harmonize content and ensure coherent, targeted dissemination.\nHumanitarian Leadership and Coordination\nUNICEF is coordinating closely with national authorities and partners including sister UN agencies, and is following\nclosely with sectoral counterparts in WASH, Health, Nutrition, Education, Social Protection, and Child Protection.\nThe Humanitarian Coordinator convened UN lead agencies and the DGPC on 22 October for a high-level meeting on\npreparedness and response. These will continue daily over the next days and complement the ongoing technical\ncoordination meetings taking place between UN and GoH partners.\nContingency Project Partnership Agreements have been activated with partners HEKS-EPER (Grand’Anse), ACCODEP\n(South), and Plan Haiti (South-East). Discussions are ongoing with these three partners to prepare them for a potential\nactivation of their agreements. In addition, a partnership with AVSI for cash transfer monitoring will be launched in the\ncoming days.\nFunding requirements\nUNICEF is reaching out to donors to secure timely, flexible funding for immediate priorities when the government and\ncommunities require support. UN CERF has allocated US$ 1.2 million to UNICEF for anticipatory action on early\nwarnings, cash assistance and prepositioning. Private sector fundraising is advancing to complement response needs.\nImmediate fundraising asks will be finalized following rapid needs assessments and ongoing coordination.\nWho to contact for Geetanjali Narayan Yannig Dussart Boris Matous\nfurther information: Representative Deputy Representative Chief Emergency, a.i.\nHaiti Country Office Haiti Country Office Haiti Country Office\nTel: +509 3996 4478 Tel: +509 4774 0011 Tel: + 509 4720 2481\nEmail: gnarayan@unicef.org Email: ydussart@unicef.org Email: bmatous@unicef.org\n2",

Departments previously on orange alert —\nSouth-East, Nippes and West — remain on heightened\nvigilance. Authorities are urging the population to follow\nofficial guidance and avoid high-risk areas.\nIn the South, 124 households living in high-risk zones\nand precarious shelters (Les Cayes, Île-à-Vache and\nCoteaux) began relocating on 24 October to three emergency shelters. Classes have been temporarily\nsuspended across the four departments of the Grand South due to severe weather and the use of schools\nas shelters.\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to\nCoordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.\nWe advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\nwww.unocha.org\n\nHaïti Situation Report No. 2\nAccording to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), unstable weather conditions are expected to\npersist, with further heavy rainfall likely to trigger flooding and landslides, particularly in coastal and\nmountainous areas.\nImpacts continue to be reported across several departments. The Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC)\nconfirms that three people died and one was severely injured following a landslide on 23 October in\nFontamara, Port-au-Prince (West).\nRivers have overflowed in several departments. The Artibonite River rose in Grande-Saline (Artibonite). In\nthe Centre department, the Lociane River flooded due to rainfall from the Dominican Republic. The Saint-\nMartin River overflowed in Sainte-Suzanne (North-East), destroying a bridge. Homes were damaged in\nPort-de-Paix (North-West), and a landslide was reported along the Maricolas – Dolan road in Artibonite.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that heavy rain and winds continue to affect\nlivelihoods across South, Nippes, Grand ‘Anse and South-East. Flooding is obstructing access to farmland\nand markets, jeopardizing harvests and the winter agricultural season. 15 hectares of maize were lost in\nMapou (South-East), with further damage to crops, livestock and fishery. Localized flooding is also\nreported in Grand’Anse.\nHumanitarian partners continue to monitor the situation and support authorities, with focus on the most\nvulnerable areas to adapt preparedness and response.\nHUMANITARIAN NEEDS\nForecasted rainfall is likely to increase the vulnerability of communities already affected by food insecurity\nand displacement. Agricultural activities and markets are disrupted, raising concerns of food price\nincreases and reduced access to food. Immediate needs identified include emergency shelter, safe\ndrinking water, sanitation, food assistance, agricultural support, and protection measures for households\nexposed to flooding and landslides.\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\nResponse efforts are focused on departments under red and orange alert: Grand’Anse, South, Nippes,\nSouth-East and West.\nCamp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM)\nThe CCCM Cluster, in coordination with the Thematic Committee on Evacuation and Temporary Shelter\nManagement (CTEGAP), is monitoring conditions in displacement sites and supporting DGPC\npreparedness measures. Site committees in Port-au-Prince have been briefed on risks linked to heavy\nrain and encouraged to enforce prevention measures. Preparedness actions include the deployment of\nsite managers, alert and feedback mechanisms, safety audits, mobile clinics, and awareness sessions.\nRisk reduction measures such as night-time lighting, locked showers and latrines, and regular protection\nmonitoring are also being implemented.\nCash / Anticipatory Action (AA)\nWFP has delivered Anticipatory Action cash transfers to approximately 9,500 households in the Grand\nSouth through social protection systems, aiming to reduce exposure and losses prior to the storm.\nA joint SMS from WFP and UNICEF will inform beneficiaries that two separate transfers will be received\nas part of the assistance.\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nwww.unocha.org\n2\n\nHaïti Situation Report No. 2\nDepartmental Preparedness Hotspots (HPDs) have been established with HEKS-EPER (Grand ‘Anse),\nACCODEP (South) and Plan Haiti (South-East). Another HPD is in place with AVSI to monitor protection-\nrelated AA cash assistance.\nCommunity Engagement & Risk Communication\nIOM is disseminating awareness messages via automated calls targeting 60,000 people in priority\ncommunes of the Grand South.\nIDEJEN has mobilized 70 youth volunteers across seven networks in South-East to conduct awareness\nactivities on flood risks. The organization produced 500 posters per department and mobilized 20\ncommunity radios across South, Nippes and Grand ‘Anse to broadcast DGPC prevention messages. A\nWhatsApp network circulates alerts and weather updates, accompanied by door-to-door outreach and\nstreet sensitization using megaphones and local radio.\nApproved preparedness messages developed with IOM, WFP, OCHA and DGPC have already reached\naround 43,000 people in the Grand South via SMS and WhatsApp.\nCoordination\nPreparedness and response continue across regional, national and departmental levels through\ninformation sharing with CDEMA, flash reports and situation reports. OCHA is compiling stock and\ncapacity mapping across the country.\nOCHA facilitated two coordination meetings on 24 October: one with partners in the Grand South, and\nanother at national level with CERF Anticipatory Action recipients and the National Inter-Cluster\nCoordination Group. Immediate response capacities were reviewed. The Grand South Humanitarian\nForum focused largely on preparedness actions ahead of the storm, with partners sharing updates on\nactivities and response capacity. Emphasis was placed on coordination with civil protection structures at\nlocal, communal and departmental levels.\nEducation\nUNESCO has 240 personnel ready to support the response, including 20 agents and psychologists for\ncivil protection support and 220 trained youth volunteers (60 in South, 60 in Grand’Anse, 100 in North and\nArtibonite). In addition, 360 school council members trained with civil protection are on standby to support\nemergency response in schools.\nFood security\nWFP has deployed staff and strengthened readiness for a potential post-storm response in Grand’Anse\nand South. Currently, around 450 MT of food is pre-positioned in the Grand South where the storm impact\nis expected to be most severe. An additional 450 MT are planned for transport to Miragoâne. WFP aims to\nassist up to 155,000 people with 15-day food rations, followed by two additional cash assistance cycles,\nusing mobile transfers and shock-responsive social protection systems in high-risk communes.\nFAO is supporting departmental agriculture offices to assess damages and risks, and is reviewing the\nneed to mobilise contingency stocks or adjust planned distributions.\nHealth\nIn coordination with the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP), PAHO/WHO is tracking health\nimpacts and supporting facility preparedness. PAHO/WHO has medical kits ready for deployment (2 IEHK,\n1 trauma kit, 1 cyclone kit) to cover 11,100 people.\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nwww.unocha.org\n3\n\nHaïti Situation Report No. 2\nMedical supplies are positioned in the West for MSPP deployment if required. Support is available for the\nmobilisation of Emergency Medical Teams and continuity of essential healthcare services.\nNo major structural damage to health facilities has been reported. However, in North-West, water leakage\npartially affected maternity and pediatrics services, prompting temporary relocation of patients. In the\nSouth, the Immaculate Conception Hospital in Les Cayes faces flood risks, and preventive actions —\nincluding patient relocation and early discharge — have been taken.\nNutrition\nUNICEF has pre-positioned nutrition supplies across the four departments of the Grand South and more\nthan 100 health facilities in South-East, South and Grand ‘Anse. Supplies for Nippes are expected to\narrive by the end of the week.\nShelter & Non-Food Items (NFI)\nIn the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, around 750 tarpaulins and installation kits are being distributed\nthrough the Common Pipeline led by IOM via ACTED, ASHAPE and CESVI, to reinforce weatherproofing\nin 11 priority sites.\nNationally, pre-positioned stocks can support 11,000 households with NFI kits and 33,000 households\nwith light shelter kits, through the Common Pipeline and partners including the Haitian Red Cross, CRS\nand DKH. In the Grand South, 4,000 NFI kits and 5,500 light shelter kits are available. The Organization of\nPersons with Disabilities (OPH) is mobilising logistics capacity to the South, while Common Pipeline\npartners continue to assess needs for potential distributions.\nIn addition, IOM is providing Anticipatory Action (AA) cash support to approximately 3,000 families in the\nGrand South to cover urgent shelter and NFI needs.\nThe Haitian Red Cross, supported by IFRC and the Spanish Red Cross, pre-positioned over 4,000\nemergency kits in South-East to meet the essential needs of a family of five, including 1,000 shelter/tool\nkits, 1,100 hygiene/sanitation kits, 1,100 kitchen kits, 900 cleaning kits, and a collective WASH kit for\naround 2,000 people.\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)\nIOM has pre-positioned hygiene kits for over 17,000 households nationwide, including 3,371 in the South\n(Camp-Perrin and Jérémie).\nNearly 2,900 WASH kits are pre-positioned in the South for approximately 14,500 people, with allocation\nongoing: 700 via HEKS-EPER (Grand ‘Anse), 700 via CEDUCC (Nippes / Les Palmes), 600 via Plan\nInternational (South-East) and 900 stored in Les Cayes (South).

      "pdf_text": "Haiti\nTropical Storm\nMelissa\nFlash Update No. 2\n© 2025/Haiti/Noel\nReporting Period: 22-27 October 2025\nHighlights\nTropical Storm Melissa has intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, moving slowly westward near Haiti’s southern\npeninsula at around 6 km/h. The storm is expected to bring 200 to 400 mm of rain, strong winds, and life-threatening\nflash floods, landslides, and mudslides on Monday 27 and Tuesday 28 October.\nThe Directorate General of Civil Protection (DGPC) has issued a red alert for the South and Grand’Anse departments,\nwith orange alerts in effect for the West, Nippes, Artibonite, and North-West, and a yellow alert for the South-East.\nUNICEF is implementing anticipatory actions and has prepositioned life-saving supplies to support children and families,\nworking in close coordination with national authorities and partners in the most at-risk areas.\nSituation Update\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has upgraded Hurricane Melissa to a Category 5 system,\nthe highest classification, with extremely powerful winds capable of causing severe destruction. While the hurricane\ncontinues to be highly intense, Haiti remains under a tropical storm watch, as current forecasts indicate the eye of the\nstorm will not make direct landfall on the country.\nOn 25 October, the Haitian authorities revised the national alert levels: the South and Grand’Anse departments were\nmoved to red alert, Nippes and the South-East to orange cyclonic alert, and the West placed under orange alert for\nheavy rainfall. The National Emergency Operations Centre remains fully mobilized to coordinate preparedness and\nresponse actions.\nBy the morning of 27 October, Melissa was tracking northward from south of Jamaica, following a path that could bring\nit closer to Haiti in the coming hours. In anticipation of worsening conditions, the Artibonite and North-West departments\nwere also placed under orange alert.\nThe outer bands of the hurricane are already producing torrential rains, strong winds, and dangerous sea conditions,\nparticularly along the Southern Peninsula and parts of the West. Forecasts suggest Grand’Anse may again experience\nsustained winds as early as Tuesday morning.\nAccording to the DGPC, three fatalities and sixteen injuries have been reported so far. Around 450 homes have been\nflooded and ten damaged, mostly in the North-West. Flooding has affected several communities in Artibonite and the\nNorth-West, while road access remains cut off in Moron (Grand’Anse), Baie d’Orange and Marigot (South-East), as well\nas Lascahobas (Centre).\nTwenty schools and high schools have been identified to serve as shelters for affected families. Nine of them are\ncurrently hosting 1,991 people in the communes of Les Cayes, Coteaux, Jean du Sud, Île-à-Vache, and Les Cayes,\nwhile 117 people have taken refuge in temporary shelters and community centers in Port-Salut and Île-à-Vache.\nUNICEF Response\nUNICEF Haiti is closely monitoring the evolution of Hurricane Melissa, maintaining constant coordination with national\ncounterparts to ensure a rapid and effective response for affected children and families.\n1\n\nIn line with its emergency preparedness procedures, UNICEF has activated internal monitoring mechanisms and is in\nregular contact with partners across education, child protection, WASH, health, nutrition, and social protection sectors\nto assess both immediate and emerging needs.\nThrough established partnerships with government institutions and NGOs, UNICEF is deploying pre-positioned supplies\nand providing technical support to reinforce the national response. Supplies are ready for dispatch pending safe access\nconditions.\nTo strengthen field coordination and ensure close liaison with departmental authorities, UNICEF has mobilized staff\nacross the affected departments. In the Grand Sud, 11 UNICEF personnel are already present in the field, including\nprogramme officers, logistics, operations, and security staff. Additional personnel have been temporarily deployed from\nPort-au-Prince to reinforce teams in Jérémie (Grand’Anse), Miragoâne (Nippes/South-East), and Les Cayes (South),\nsupporting coordination with the DGPC and ongoing preparedness and response operations.\nAt the same time, UNICEF continues to share preparedness, prevention, and response messages throughout the\nduration of the storm.\nHealth\nUNICEF is deploying emergency health kits, including kits for the management of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) and\nmidwifery kits, to meet the needs of 20,000 people, support 500 deliveries, and ensure treatment for 400 cases of acute\nwatery diarrhoea.\nNutrition\nThe Nutrition Cluster, co-led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) and UNICEF, launched on 22\nOctober 2025 a mapping exercise of nutrition supplies across health institutions in the South, South-East, Nippes, and\nGrand’Anse departments. The assessment identified 46 health institutions that require support and seven potential\npartners to support the implementation of the nutrition response.\nA total of 176 health facilities have now been supplied with ready-to-use-therapeutic-food (RUTF), and other nutrition\nsupplies, covering the needs of 4,175 children across the departments of South (46 facilities), Grand’Anse (42), Nippes\n(37), and South-East (51).\nContinuous coordination with the four departmental health directorates of the Greater South region is maintained to\nensure coherence and efficiency of the response.\nWASH\nUNICEF has pre-positioned 2,900 WASH kits in the South department, including Jérémie (700 kits), Jacmel (600),\nMiragoâne (400), Léogâne (400), and Les Cayes (800), to cover approximately 14,500 people and ensure a rapid\nresponse to the needs of affected families.\nHumanitarian Cash transfer\nUNICEF is providing cash assistance to households affected by the storm in alignment with OCHA guidelines, ensuring\ncoordination with WFP to maximize impact. Each targeted household has received US$192, of which UNICEF\ncontributed US$92 to complement WFP’s support. Through this intervention, UNICEF has assisted approximately 7,250\nhouseholds affected by the crisis.\nCommunication with Communities\nA total of 470 U-Reporters have been mobilized across the Grand South region with over 137,000 awareness messages\nsent via SMS and WhatsApp, reinforcing community mobilization and preparedness efforts ahead of and during the\nstorm.\nSix sound trucks were deployed to broadcast awareness messages one in each of the South, South-East, and\nGrand’Anse departments, and three in the Nippes.\nFurthermore, 2,200 awareness posters were distributed in communities, and 19 community radios were engaged (4 in\nthe South, 5 in the South-East, 5 in Grand’Anse, and 4 in the Nippes), airing rotating radio spots and hosting 22\ninteractive programmes to expand outreach.\nHumanitarian Leadership and Coordination\nUNICEF is coordinating closely with national and departmental authorities, humanitarian partners, and UN agencies,\nand is following closely with sectoral counterparts in WASH, Health, Nutrition, Education, Social Protection, and Child\n2\n\nProtection. UNICEF is actively participating in inter-agency coordination through the UNETE and national clusters,\nproviding sectoral leadership and technical inputs to the DGPC-led response.\nContingency Project Partnership Agreements have been established with HEKS-EPER (Grand’Anse), ACCODEP\n(South), and Plan Haiti (South-East). Preparations for their activation are well advanced with partners coordinating\nclosely with departmental authorities and UNICEF field team for rapid start of activities when conditions require.\nFunding requirements\nUNICEF is reaching out to donors to secure timely, flexible funding for immediate priorities when the government and\ncommunities require support. UNCERF has allocated US$ 1.2 million to UNICEF for anticipatory action on early\nwarnings, cash assistance and prepositioning. Private sector fundraising is advancing to complement response needs.\nImmediate fundraising asks will be finalized following rapid needs assessments and ongoing coordination.\nWho to contact for Geetanjali Narayan Yannig Dussart Boris Matous\nfurther information: Representative Deputy Representative Chief Emergency, a.i.\nHaiti Country Office Haiti Country Office Haiti Country Office\nTel: +509 3996 4478 Tel: +509 4774 0011 Tel: + 509 4720 2481\nEmail: gnarayan@unicef.org Email: ydussart@unicef.org Email: bmatous@unicef.org\n3",

Although the system\nremains intense, Haiti is under a tropical storm alert, as the hurricane’s core is not expected to make direct\nlandfall on the country.\nOn 25 October, the Government adjusted alert levels: the South and Grand ‘Anse departments were\nplaced under red alert, Nippes and the South-East under orange cyclonic alert, and the West under\norange alert for heavy rains. The National Emergency Operations Centre remains fully activated.\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to\nCoordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.\nWe advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\nwww.unocha.org\n\nHaïti Situation Report No. 1\nAs of the morning of 27 October, Melissa was located south of Jamaica, moving gradually northward,\npotentially approaching Haiti in the following hours. The Artibonite and North-West departments are now\nunder orange alert, due to expected worsening weather conditions.\nPeripheral rain bands continue to bring heavy rainfall, strong winds and rough seas, mainly over the\nsouthern peninsula and parts of the West. The Grand ‘Anse department is at high risk of renewed strong\nwinds by Tuesday morning.\nAccording to the Civil Protection Directorate, since the start of the episode, three deaths and 16 injuries\nhave been reported. Nearly 450 houses were flooded and 10 houses damaged, mainly in the North-West.\nRoad access remains cut in Moron (Grand ‘Anse), Baie d’Orange and Marigot (South-East), as well as\nLascahobas (Centre).\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports damage to agricultural livelihoods in the South,\nGrand ‘Anse and South-East departments, including the loss of banana, avocado, maize, bean and\npigeon pea crops, livestock losses in the South-East, and the destruction of fishing gear. Fishing activities\nremain suspended.\nHUMANITARIANS NEEDS\nPartners report urgent needs for emergency shelter, safe drinking water, sanitation, food assistance,\nagricultural recovery, and protection support for households exposed to floods and landslides.\nAccording to FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture (MARNDR), field assessments are required to guide\nsupport, particularly for the rehabilitation of rural infrastructure and the distribution of agricultural and\nfishing inputs.\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\nResponse efforts are focusing on the departments under red and orange alert, namely Grand ‘Anse,\nSouth, Nippes, South-East and West.\nCash Assistance\nThe WFP has already provided anticipatory cash assistance to over 47,000 people in high-risk areas,\nhelping families prepare and cope with the storm’s impact.\nUNICEF has supported around 7,250 vulnerable households with emergency cash assistance to meet\nessential needs and strengthen family resilience, while supporting the recovery of local markets.\nCommunication and Community Awareness\nUNICEF supported community mobilization in the Grand Sud through 470 U-Reporters, young volunteers\nspreading awareness messages within their communities. This effort also included six sound trucks\ndeployed across the South, South-East, Grand ‘Anse and Nippes, and 19 community radios, which\nbroadcasted 22 interactive programs. In total, 2,200 posters were distributed and over 137,000 messages\nsent via SMS and WhatsApp, in coordination with the Civil Protection Directorate.\nUNFPA integrated key prevention and safety messages into its outreach plan, disseminated through the\nKay Fanm hotline and safe spaces for women and girls.\nIn partnership with the Civil Protection Directorate, WFP sent 3.5 million SMS alerts to at-risk populations,\nsharing anticipatory and safety messages.\nEducation\nUNICEF plans to provide psychosocial support, school kits, and tents to help children resume schooling\nquickly after the storm.\nFood Security\nWFP and partners plan to support 155,000 people in the South and Grand ‘Anse with immediate\nassistance, including 15 days of food and, when markets allow, one month of cash transfers. WFP offices\nin the North and Artibonite remain on high alert for potential emergency activation.\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nwww.unocha.org\n\nHaïti Situation Report No. 1\nWFP has also secured climate risk financing mechanisms, including potential post-shock insurance\npayments through the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and microinsurance for\nsmall farmers and social protection programs.\nA total of 452 metric tons of food have been pre-positioned in the Grand Sud, with 360 tons ready to be\ndeployed from Port-au-Prince, enough for 86,000 people for two weeks.

A total of 43 people lost their lives, 21 were injured,\nand 13 remain missing. Among the fatalities, 25 occurred in Petit-Goâve (West Department), including 10 children.\nOver 11,900 houses were flooded, 176 destroyed, and 4,257 damaged to varying degrees. Around 16,000 people had\nsought refuge in temporary shelters.\nAccording to the DGPC, the departments of South, Grand’Anse, South-East, Nippes, West, Artibonite, and North-\nWest were among the most affected. Road infrastructure sustained severe damage, particularly in Grand’Anse, where\nseveral communal sections remain isolated, hampering humanitarian access. The Ministry of Public Works continues\ndebris clearance and repair operations to reopen key routes and facilitate aid delivery.\nOn the health front, hospitals largely withstood the hurricane, though minor flooding was reported at Les Cayes\nHospital and limited damage in Jérémie and Port-de-Paix.\nHUMANITARIAN NEEDS\nPartners report urgent needs for emergency shelter, safe drinking water, sanitation, food assistance,\nagricultural recovery support, and medicines.\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to\nCoordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.\nWe advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\nwww.unocha.org\n\nHaïti Situation Report No. 2\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\nCommunity Communication and Awareness\nIn Grand ’Anse, within the PAER project, HEKS/EPER supported Civil Protection in disseminating early\nwarning messages to remote communities before the hurricane’s passage.\nEducation\nUNESCO is supporting Civil Protection in the South and Grand ‘Anse to provide psychosocial support to\nstudents and school staff.\nPriorities include assessing damage in 75 schools used as shelters, distributing materials (boots, vests,\ncaps, megaphones, etc.) to Civil Protection, and conducting psychosocial and awareness sessions in 60\nschools across South, Grand ‘Anse, and Artibonite.\nFood Security\nAs of 2 November, WFP had assisted 12,700 people with food distributions, in coordination with DGPC\nand local authorities, prioritizing displaced populations in shelters and hard-to-reach rural areas.\nIn about 30 shelters, WFP provided 12,600 people with five-day food rations, allowing community kitchens\nto serve hot meals. A phased approach is being implemented, with 15-day take-home rations followed by\none month of cash transfers to reach over 190,000 affected people in Grand’Anse, South, and Nippes.\nWFP estimates that around 1.25 million people were affected by the storm, of whom 360,000 require\nurgent food assistance. WFP plans to assist 190,000 people through in-kind food distributions and cash-\nbased transfers. Funding needs for the food response are estimated at USD 18 million, including USD 6.7\nmillion for CBT and 1,784 metric tons of food.\nGender-Based Violence and Sexual and Reproductive Health\nUNFPA prepositioned emergency reproductive health kits in 43 health facilities, covering up to 4,200\ndeliveries and 180 cases of sexual violence.

      "pdf_text": "Haiti - Food Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nPersistent insecurity and the effects of Hurricane Melissa maintain Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and\nEmergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity\nKey Messages\nThe persistence of gang violence continues to cause forced\ndisplacement of the population, disrupt income-earning\nactivities, and affect typical market functioning. Between\nOctober 2025 and May 2026, Emergency (IPC Phase 4)\noutcomes are expected in Cité Soleil, Port-au-Prince, Croix-\ndes-Bouquets, as well as among internally displaced persons\n(IDPs) living in sites in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area\n(ZMPP). At the same time, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are\nanticipated in several departments of the country.\nAs insecurity intensifies, particularly in the ZMPP, and gang\nactivity expands into Artibonite and Centre, between 3.0 and\n3.49 million people will be in need of food assistance\nbetween October 2025 and May 2026, and peak between\nApril and May 2026.\nMore than 1.4 million IDPs are recorded in Haiti, including\napproximately 210,000 in precarious sites in the ZMPP, with\nlimited access to markets and essential services. IDPs have lost\ntheir livelihoods and depend on limited and intermittent food\nassistance.\nThe passage of Hurricane Melissa caused extensive losses of\nautumn crops and livestock across the Grand Sud( Sud, Sud-\nEst, Nippes, Grand'Anse), as well as parts of Ouest and\nArtibonite. Flooding damaged key transportation infrastructure,\nsocial facilities, and IDP shelter sites. These impacts compromise\nthe income and food access of affected households and have\nled to an increase in the number of people in need between\nNovember and December 2025.\nInflation remains high, reaching 31.9 percent, while food\ninflation exceeds 35 percent in September 2025. Prices increased\nby 1.8 percent between August and September 2025. Food\ncommodity prices remain significantly above the five-year\naverage, reducing household purchasing power.\nThe analysis in this report is based on information available as\nof October 31, 2025.\nFEWS NET Haiti\nFEWS NET is a United States Government-funded activity. The content of this report does not\nhaiti@fews.net\nnecessarily reflect the view of the United States Government.\nfews.net/latin-america-and-caribbean/haiti\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nFood security context\nPersistent insecurity remains one of the main determining factors of food insecurity in Haiti. Armed gang\nactivities have intensified in Port-au-Prince since the 2000s, despite a period of calm between 2006 and 2011. Since\n2019, the resurgence of armed gang-related violence, particularly in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area (ZMPP),\nhas profoundly disrupted household livelihoods. This violence has led to the displacement of more than 1.4 million\npeople, hindered the functioning of markets, limited humanitarian access, and compromised essential economic\nactivities.\nThe ZMPP, which has a population of nearly 3 million, constitutes the epicenter of violence and\napproximately 90 percent is now controlled by armed groups. This situation has paralyzed income-generating\nactivities, particularly informal trade, street vending, and casual labor, which represent more than 90 percent of poor\nurban households' income. Gang violence, in their effort to expand their territory of control, now extends beyond the\nmetropolitan area, particularly affecting the departments of Artibonite and Centre. Furthermore, gangs have\nestablished checkpoints on major roads, notably the national highways connecting the capital to the north, center,\nand south of the country, where they impose illegal taxes, thus hindering freedom of movement and the supply\nchain. The markets of Croix-des-Bossales and Croix-des-Bouquets are more than 80 percent non-functional due to\nviolence and looting. Insecurity has led to a sharp decline in income for most households, both displaced and non-\ndisplaced, affecting both formal and informal activities.\nMacroeconomic conditions have severely deteriorated. The country has experienced seven consecutive years of\neconomic contraction between 2019 and 2025. The GDP, having already recorded a decline of more than 4 percent\nduring fiscal year 2023/24, is contracting further in 2024/25, given the current context of sociopolitical and security\ncrisis, as well as the slowdown in various economic sectors. The general price level remains high, reaching an average\nof nearly 32 percent year-on-year, with food inflation exceeding 35 percent in September 2025. Moreover, although\nprices of imported products have been relatively stable for three years, they remain above the five-year average,\nwhich reduces household purchasing power and their access to markets, the main source of food.\nNational agricultural production is also affected by insecurity and a lack of public investment. Agriculture,\nalthough secondary to imports, remains an essential source of income and food for rural households. However,\ninsecurity has led to the abandonment of arable land, particularly in the departments of Artibonite, Centre, and\nOuest. The persistence of insecurity and the deterioration of the economic context limit the government's capacity to\ninvest in the improvement and maintenance of agricultural infrastructure. In certain key areas, such as Liancourt,\nVerrettes, and Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite, gangs control irrigation systems and impose illegal payments for access\nto water. Although the country has three agricultural production seasons — spring, fall, and winter — spring\nconstitutes the main season and contributes 60 percent of the national production. However, the abandonment of\nfields and below-average rainfall recorded during the first half of 2025 have contributed to a below-average spring\nharvest.\nLearn more\nThe following links provide additional information:\nLatest Haiti Food Security Outlook Report: October 2024-May 2025\nLatest Haiti Key Message Update: July-September 2025\nOverview of FEWS NET’s scenario development methodology\nFEWS NET’s approach to estimating the population in need\nOverview of the IPC and IPC-compatible analysis\nFEWS NET’s approach to humanitarian food assistance analysis\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 2\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nCurrent anomalies in food security conditions as of October 2025\nInsecurity has deteriorated in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan Figure 1\narea and is extending toward Lower-Artibonite and Centre.\nFlooded areas by department, October\nArmed violence remains concentrated in the ZMPP, where gangs\n29-30, 2025\ncontrol nearly 90 percent of the territory. Gang violence incidents\nhave multiplied, with 70 percent concentrated in Ouest, and an\nincrease in attacks in Bas-Artibonite, Centre, and certain areas of\nSud, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED)\nand Partner Liaison Security Office (PLSO). These attacks have\nresulted in more than 1.4 million IDPs, 210,000 of which are\nlocated in sites with precarious living conditions. The majority of\nIDPs (85 percent) are hosted by rural families, further straining\nalready limited resources. These massive displacements disrupt\nagricultural and non-agricultural livelihoods and exacerbate the\nvulnerability of host households. Recurrent violence has also\nslowed trade and investment, blocked the delivery of agricultural\ninputs, and gangs have imposed passage fees on main routes (RN1,\nRN2, RN3). Humanitarian access remains restricted, particularly in\nthe ZMPP, where distributions are often interrupted.\nAlthough Hurricane Melissa did not make landfall in Haiti, it\ncaused flooding and landslides that resulted in loss of life (43 deaths, including 25 in Petit-Goâve), the\ndestruction of roads and infrastructure, as well as significant losses in the agricultural, livestock and\nfisheries sectors. Satellite analysis conducted by REACH assessed the extent of flooded areas (Figure 1). The most\naffected departments are Sud, Sud-Est, Nippes, Grand'Anse, Ouest (Leogane and Petit-Goâve), and Artibonite. More\nthan 15,861 people were affected and housed in temporary shelters, mainly in Grand Sud. In addition, several IDP\nsites in the ZMPP were flooded, worsening the already precarious living conditions of these households. Banana,\nsorghum, pigeon pea, maize, fruit tree, root, and tuber crops were damaged. In Sud-Est, damage to road\ninfrastructure affected the route connecting Jacmel to Port-au-Prince as well as local roads in Belle-Anse and Marigot.\nThe destroyed roads disrupted supply chains, market access, and the delivery of emergency humanitarian assistance.\nThe damage caused by Hurricane Melissa negatively impacted livelihoods, income and market access, as well as food\naccess for affected households. Although comprehensive assessments of the hurricane's impacts on food security\nconditions are ongoing, an update will be provided in the next report.\nAgricultural production for 2024/25, particularly spring harvests in June-July, temporarily improved local food\navailability and reduced household dependence on market purchases; however, low yields due to lack of\ninputs and insecurity prevented meaningful improvements to household consumption. Cereal production\n(maize, rice, sorghum) in particular fell by 12 percent compared to 2023/24 and by 24 percent compared to the five-\nyear average. Local products (mangoes, avocados, bananas, tubers) only cover one to two months of consumption\nstocks for poor households. In several areas of Nord-Ouest and Artibonite, households have already exhausted their\nreserves and depend almost exclusively on the market.\nThe Haitian economy is recording a seventh consecutive year of recession, with GDP decline estimated at 1\npercent in 2025. General inflation reached 31 percent in August 2025 and 34 percent for food products. Although\nthe exchange rate has stabilized around 130–131 HTG/USD since early 2024, purchasing power remains severely\neroded. Structural dependence on imports, combined with high transportation and energy costs, continues to restrict\nfood access for poor and very poor households.\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 3\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nVarious sources of income are declining for poor and very poor households. Decreased income from the sale of\nagricultural products in 2025 is due to limited market access and input costs. Agricultural labor is contracting, and\nbelow-average demand is resulting in wage stagnation. Non-agricultural activities are declining under the impacts of\ninsecurity and weak demand. Off-own-farm income is falling, pushing households to adopt negative coping strategies\nsuch as the sale of productive assets, reducing meal size and quantity, and internal migration.\nIn the ZMPP, market functioning and supply remain disrupted by insecurity, leading to price increases for\nbasic commodities. Security disruptions continue to hinder access to the Port-au-Prince port, forcing importers to\nfavor the Cap-Haïtien port. This logistical reorganization has reduced imported volume and increased transportation\ncosts. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a significant portion of rice shipments has been\nredirected to Nord, a flow anomaly causing delays and additional costs.\nRegional markets (Grand Nord, Artibonite, Centre, Grand Sud) remain supplied, but prices are high due to\ntransportation costs and fuel scarcity. In August 2025, continued increases in basic commodity prices were observed,\nincluding more than 13 percent for wheat flour, more than 18 percent for vegetable oil, and more than 9 percent for\nimported rice. Local products (roots, tubers, green maize) remain available, but at prices far exceeding the five-year\naverage, limiting food accessibility for poor households — a persistent anomaly linked to logistical shocks, input\ninflation, and market fragmentation.\nHumanitarian food assistance\nIn October 2025, assistance remains far below the level of need and faces severe operational and financial\nconstraints. WFP has suspended hot meals for newly displaced persons and reduced general rations by 50 percent\nsince June 2025 due to funding challenges, and has been unable to preposition food supplies for the cyclone season.\nPartners report intermittent coverage in the ZMPP and around displacement sites, with access interruptions due to\nviolence and high logistical costs. Furthermore, the impacts of Hurricane Melissa have further increased the\nimmediate need for emergency food assistance. Despite this, food assistance volumes remain insufficient in\nrelation to sharply rising demand, while the 2025 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains underfunded.\nAs a result, the impact of assistance on consumption deficits is limited and highly heterogeneous depending on\nhumanitarian access.\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 4\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nCurrent acute food insecurity outcomes as of October 2025\nIDP households living in host sites in Port-au-Prince remain in\nEmergency (Phase 4), primarily due to insecurity that has forced\nthem to abandon their homes and is resulting in the loss of their\nlivelihoods. These households face a severe lack of employment\nopportunities, which severely limits their ability to earn income.\nHumanitarian assistance, although present intermittently in these\nhost sites, does not even cover 25 percent of their essential needs.\nConsequently, the majority of these households continue to resort to\nextreme survival strategies, such as begging, child labor, sale of\nhousehold goods, and even petty urban crime.\nIn the ZMPP, the communes of Port-au-Prince, Cité Soleil, and\nCornillon and Ganthier in Croix-des-Bouquets, are in Emergency\n(IPC Phase 4). These areas are marked by an intensification of armed\nviolence, prolonged disruptions of the food supply chain, a sharp\ndecline in income, and high prices. These combined factors severely\naffect household access to food and livelihoods, resulting in significant\nfood consumption deficits. According to the 2025 Multi-Sector Needs\nAssessment (MSNA) survey, 37, 25, and 16 percent of surveyed\nhouseholds in Cité Soleil, Cornillon, and Croix-des-Bouquets,\nrespectively, reported not having food often. However, the other\ncommunes constituting the ZMPP are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) due to\nthe impacts of insecurity on their livelihoods, particularly income-\ngenerating activities and access to markets, which are limiting their\naccess to food.\nOther regions of the country remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) due to gang violence, declining purchasing power, as\nwell as disruptions to transportation and market supply due to illegal roadblocks. Households are resorting to\nnegative coping strategies to meet their food needs, including sales of animals, intensification of charcoal production,\nand taking on debts to purchase food.\nIn the Nord-Ouest, late spring rains caused below-average harvests and reduced demand for agricultural labor.\nSeasonal incomes for poor households are therefore atypically low, while prices of basic commodities (rice, oil, flour)\nremain high. Pockets of households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) are observed in the communes of Baie-de-Henne,\nBombardopolis, La Tortue, Môle-Saint-Nicolas, and Jean-Rabel.\nIn the Grand Sud (Sud, Sud-Est, Grand'Anse, Nippes), despite near-average spring harvests in some areas, the influx\nof IDPs from Port-au-Prince increases pressure on host households and local resources, exacerbating their\nvulnerability. High transportation prices due to illegal roadblocks on RN2 continue to impact markets. Poor\nhouseholds are engaging in coping strategies such as selling their animals, intensifying charcoal production, and\ntaking on debts to maintain food consumption. Furthermore, the floods of late September 2025 and the passage of\nHurricane Melissa, affecting Sud, Nippes, and Grand'Anse, destroyed autumn crops and damaged secondary roads,\nhindering the transport of agricultural products to trading locations. This resulted in income losses for farmers and\nindirectly for agricultural workers, significantly reducing food access for affected poor households and increasing the\nnumber of people in need emergency food assistance.\nIn Artibonite and Centre, a rapid deterioration of access and availability conditions linked to the expansion of armed\ngroups is observed, disrupting livelihoods, household food sources, inter-urban trade and access to rural markets.\nFood prices remain high in the major markets of Gonaïves, Saint-Marc, and Mirebalais where supply disruptions are\nfrequent. Due to the negative impacts of the resurgence of violence on food access, resulting in more pronounced\nfood consumption deficits, pockets of households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) are observed in the communes of La\nChapelle, Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite, Liancourt, Mirebalais, Saut d'Eau, Lascahobas (Centre).\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 5\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nThe Nord and Nord-Est departments present a relatively stable but fragile situation, with constraints related to fuel\nand weak demand for non-agricultural work. This results in difficult and limited access to basic food products given\nthe high prices that poor and very poor households face. Additionally, the nutritional situation of children under five\nis at the Alert threshold, particularly for the Nord-Est, with a GAM rate near 10 percent according to MSPP.\nUNICEF, at the beginning of October 2025, estimates that approximately 288,500 children under five are\nsuffering from acute malnutrition in the context of massive displacement and collapse of health services. In June\n2025, 30,376 children were screened countrywide and more than 9,600 cases of severe acute malnutrition (SAM)\nwere admitted for treatment, nearly triple the number recorded in May. This increase reflects strong pressure on\nnutritional care capacities. The aggravating factors of this deterioration are primarily insecurity disrupting access to\ncare, food inflation reducing diet quality, waterborne disease (cholera/diarrhea), and limited access to safe water and\nsanitation. High-risk areas include the ZMPP, displacement camps, and pockets of households in Artibonite and the\nCentral Plateau, where humanitarian access is restricted and child morbidity is high.\nKey assumptions about atypical food security conditions underpinning the most likely scenario through\nMay 2026\nIn Haiti, gang-fueled violence has intensified in the ZMPP, nearly 90 percent of which is now under gang control.\nHomicides and attacks against civilians and security forces are expected to remain at their current level in the\nvery short term, before experiencing an increase by February 2026 and likely beyond.\nGangs are expected to extend their grip toward Centre and Artibonite, causing violence, forced displacement,\nand disruptions to livelihoods, markets, and trade. Persistent restrictions on major routes around the capital\n(Port-au-Prince) will continue to hinder trade between the capital and the rest of the country.\nGang-related insecurity, which impacts the main national roads (RN1, RN2, and RN3), will likely continue to\ndisrupt the supply of urban markets, particularly those in the ZMPP, and limit movement between major cities.\nDue to the persistence of violence, population displacement is likely to continue in Artibonite, Centre, and the\nZMPP. This dynamic is expected to continue from October 2025 to May 2026, given the weakness of the state\nresponse to armed gangs. Meanwhile, nearly 227,000 Haitians have been repatriated from January to\nNovember 2, 2025, the vast majority (98 percent) from the Dominican Republic. Expulsions are expected to\ncontinue over the outlook period.\nApart from the passage of Hurricane Melissa, which caused above-average rainfall, the combination of near-\naverage precipitation and above-average temperatures could reduce soil moisture, increase evapotranspiration,\nand consequently limit growth and decrease yields of fall and winter crops such as maize, beans, roots, and\ntubers.\nThe reference exchange rate of the Banque de la République d'Haïti (BRH) will likely remain stable around 130\nHTG/USD during the projection period. The requirement to receive remittances from the diaspora only in HTG\nand banking restrictions limiting daily cash withdrawals and foreign currency acquisitions (daily caps) reduce\nimmediate pressure on the market. Moreover, weak demand for foreign currency, linked to the contraction of\neconomic activities and the decline in imports, would contribute to limiting pressure on the dollar.\nRelative price stability for imported rice varieties is expected in the Haitian market, particularly at Croix-des-\nBossales. Near-record production and substantial rice stocks (USDA) are expected to lead to a decline in global\nprices, while sustained record supply in Asian countries should maintain low prices throughout the forecast\nperiod. Prices for products such as wheat (for flour) and edible oil are expected to be similarly stable.\nLocal prices for yellow maize, black beans, and local rice are expected to remain above average and likely to\nincrease seasonally during the February to May lean season.\nAnnual food inflation is expected to remain above 30 percent, with seasonal increases anticipated toward the\nend of the year. Overall inflationary pressures are expected to intensify, driven by rising costs of transportation,\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 6\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nfood, and utilities.\nFuel supply is expected to remain limited by insecurity and disruptions to distribution routes and storage sites.\nDespite international stability, local prices are anticipated to remain above the five-year average due to\ntransportation costs and logistical constraints.\nRemittances are expected to remain significant, exceeding the average and 2024 levels, and support household\nconsumption throughout 2025 and 2026. In 2026, remittances are expected to decrease compared to 2025 but\nremain above average. The tightening of migration policies and new taxes on money transfers from the United\nStates are expected to discourage remittances.\nThe income of poor households, both in rural and urban areas, will likely be below the five-year average due to\nthe continued decline of key economic activities. In rural areas, the decrease in income will result primarily from\nreduced profits from the sale of agricultural labor due to high input costs, the scarcity and high cost of\nagricultural labor, as well as persistent disruptions in the distribution chain due to insecurity. In urban areas,\nsmall-scale trade, a key source of income, would also experience a notable decline.\nHumanitarian food assistance\nFor the projection period (October 2025-May 2026), food assistance coverage is expected to be low.\nFurthermore, given the significant reduction in rations since June, funding challenges and logistical and security\nconstraints, it is likely that the level of assistance will decrease further during the projection period.\nProjected acute food insecurity outcomes through May 2026\nFrom October 2025 to May 2026, Cité Soleil, Port-au-Prince, Croix-des-Bouquets, as well as IDPs in sites in the\nZMPP, will remain in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The resurgence of clashes between gangs and security forces\nseverely restricts mobility and access to local markets, while the main supply routes (RN1, RN2, RN3) remain under\nthe influence or intermittent control of armed groups. This gang violence causes prolonged disruptions to markets\nand logistical flows. The closure or irregular operation of the Croix-des-Bossales, Croix-des-Bouquets, and Cité Soleil\nmarkets continues to disrupt the supply of basic commodities, leading to increased prices and limiting local\navailability. Moreover, the livelihoods of the majority of poor households have deteriorated (informal trade,\ntransport, domestic services), resulting in declining income and weak purchasing power. Some households will\ncontinue to resort to coping strategies such as begging, selling productive assets, skipping meals, and withdrawing\nchildren from school, and food assistance is insufficient to cover the population in need. In addition, IDPs live in\novercrowded conditions marked by insecurity, malnutrition, and cases of acute diarrhea, with very limited access to\nwater and healthcare further aggravating food insecurity.\nThe majority of the country's departments will remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) from October 2025 to May 2026,\nwith pockets of households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) persisting in the Nord-Ouest (HT01–HT02), the Bas Plateau\nCentral, and certain areas of Artibonite (notably Petite-Rivière, Verrettes, and L'Estère). In the ZMPP, the communes\nof Carrefour, Delmas, Pétion-Ville, and Tabarre will maintain slightly less degraded conditions due to a partial\nrecovery of urban service and trade activities. However, security volatility, high transportation costs, and the\ncontraction of small-scale trade income will continue to restrict access to food.\nIn rural areas — notably in the Nord, Nord-Est, Centre, and areas affected by Hurricane Melissa including Sud-Est,\nSud, Ouest (notably Petit Goave, Leogane), Nippes, Artibonite and Grand'Anse — the persistent decline in cereal\nproduction (rice, maize, sorghum), lack of inputs, above-average prices, and heavy market dependence will prevent\nhouseholds from meeting their minimum food needs. Households in the south will continue to suffer the residual\neffects of the hurricane until the end of the year, experiencing negative impacts to the winter season (starting in\nDecember), and possibly even the start of the spring season. This will limit the ability of farmers to hire workers or\npurchase seeds. In addition, mass repatriations from the Dominican Republic and internal displacements will\nincrease pressure on already vulnerable host communities.\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 7\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nIn the Nord-Ouest, the series of failed agricultural seasons due to drought, lack of inputs, and environmental\ndegradation has reduced local availability to a historic low level. In the Plateau Central and Bas Artibonite, armed\ngang violence disrupts trade along RN1, RN2 and with the Dominican Republic, affecting the flow of products and\nagricultural income. These areas therefore combine low food availability, limited access, and severely eroded income.\nAnnex 1: Key sources of evidence used in this analysis\nData\nEvidence Source format Food security element of analysis\nLivelihoods profiles FEWS NET Qualitative Typical sources of food and income by livelihood\nzone\nOutlook on cereal supply FEWS NET Qualitative/ Analysis of national and regional cereal supply\nand markets in Haiti Quantitative and demand trends; monitoring of imports,\ninternal flows, stock levels, and price\nmovements in major markets\nAnnual grain report USDA Qualitative/ Global and regional cereal production trends;\nproduced by the U.S. Quantitative impact on international prices and availability in\nDepartment of Agriculture Haitian markets\n(USDA)\nMonetary Policy Note, BRH Qualitative/ Inflation, exchange rates, money supply, and\nApril–June 2025 Quantitative their impacts on purchasing power and food\nprices\nFood Security Cluster FSC Qualitative/ Geographic and temporal coverage of food\ndistribution plans, including Quantitative assistance, number of beneficiaries, and trends\nhistorical trend analysis in humanitarian coverage\nHaiti – Internal Displacement International Qualitative/ Number of IDPs, causes of displacement, areas\nSituation Report – Round 10 Organization Quantitative of concentration, and impacts on livelihoods\n(June 2025) for Migration and food access\n(IOM)\nConflict analyses ACLED, PLSO Qualitative/ Number of violent incidents, affected areas,\nQuantitative conflict trends, and impacts on market access,\nproduction, and population movements\nKey informant interviews, FEWS NET Qualitative/ Field information on prices, food availability,\nincluding FEWS NET price Quantitative survival strategies, local perceptions, and\nenumerators, community market trends\nleaders, and others\nFood Security Survey REACH/MSNA Qualitative/ Field data collected by REACH on food security\nQuantitative conditions, including consumption, livelihoods,\nand coping strategies by region\nCPI Haitian Quantitative Information used to measure inflation rates for\nInstitute for food and non-food items, including local and\nStatistics and imported products\nInformatics\n(IHSI)\nReports OCHA Qualitative/ Monitoring of the humanitarian situation,\nQuantitative sectoral coverage, aid financing, priority\nintervention areas, and intersectoral\ncoordination\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 8\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nData\nEvidence Source format Food security element of analysis\nHaitian Market Monitoring – WFP Market Food security analysis report\nAugust 2025 analysis and\nmonitoring\nAnalytical Report WFP Qualitative Analysis of the impact of violence on food\nsecurity in the Haitian capital amid declining\nfood assistance\nNews Article Miami Herald, Qualitative/ Article on the impact of Hurricane Melissa\nHaitian Times quantitative\nEmergency Response World Vision Qualitative Rapid assessment of the impact of Hurricane\nUpdate situation Melissa\nreport\nAnnex 2: FEWS NET’s analytical approach explained\nEarly warning of acute food insecurity outcomes requires forecasting months in advance to provide decision makers with\nsufficient time to budget, plan, and respond to expected humanitarian crises. However, due to the complex and variable\nfactors that influence acute food insecurity, definitive predictions are impossible. Scenario Development is a methodology\nthat allows FEWS NET to meet decision makers’ needs by developing a “most likely” scenario of the future.\nFEWS NET’s scenario development process applies the Disaster Risk Reduction framework and a livelihoods-based lens to\nassess acute food insecurity outcomes. A household’s risk of acute food insecurity depends not only on hazards (such as\ndrought) but also the household’s vulnerability to these hazards (e.g., the level of dependence on rainfed crop production\nfor food and income) and coping capacity (which considers both the household’s ability to cope with a given hazard and the\nuse of negative coping strategies that harm future capacity). To evaluate these factors, FEWS NET bases this analysis on a\nstrong foundational understanding of local livelihoods. FEWS NET’s scenario development process also accounts for the\nSustainable Livelihoods Framework; the Four Dimensions of Food Security; and UNICEF’s Nutrition Conceptual Framework,\nand is closely aligned with the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analytical framework.\nHow does FEWS NET analyze current acute food insecurity outcomes? FEWS NET assesses the extent to which\nhouseholds can meet their minimum caloric needs. This analysis converges evidence of current food security\nconditions with available direct evidence of household-level food consumption and livelihood change. FEWS NET also\nconsiders available area-level evidence of nutritional status and mortality, focusing on whether these reflect the\nphysiological impacts of acute food insecurity. FEWS NET uses the globally recognized five-phase Integrated Food\nSecurity Phase Classification (IPC) scale to classify current acute food insecurity outcomes, and the analysis is IPC-\ncompatible. In addition, FEWS NET applies the “!” symbol to designate areas where the mapped IPC Phase would\nlikely be at least one IPC Phase worse without the effects of ongoing humanitarian food assistance.\nHow does FEWS NET develop key assumptions underpinning the most likely scenario? A key step in FEWS NET’s\nscenario development process is the development of evidence-based assumptions about factors that affect food\nsecurity. These include hazards and anomalies in food security conditions that will impact the evolution of household\nfood and income during the projection period, as well as factors that may affect nutritional status. FEWS NET also\ndevelops assumptions about factors expected to behave normally. Together, these assumptions form the foundation\nof the “most likely” scenario.\nHow does FEWS NET analyze projected acute food insecurity outcomes? Using the key assumptions that underpin\nthe “most likely” scenario, FEWS NET projects acute food insecurity outcomes by assessing the evolution of households’\nability to meet their minimum caloric needs over time. FEWS NET converges expectations of the likely trajectory of\nhousehold-level food consumption and livelihood change with area-level nutritional status and mortality. FEWS NET\nthen classifies acute food insecurity outcomes using the IPC scale. Lastly, FEWS NET applies the “!” symbol to designate\nany areas where the mapped IPC Phase would likely be at least one IPC Phase worse without the effects of planned –\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 9\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nand likely to be funded and delivered – food assistance.\nHow does FEWS NET analyze humanitarian food assistance? Humanitarian food assistance – defined as\nemergency food assistance (in-kind, cash, or voucher) – may play a key role in mitigating the severity of acute food\ninsecurity outcomes. FEWS NET analysts always incorporate available information on food assistance, with the caveat\nthat such information can vary significantly across geographies and over time. In line with IPC protocols, FEWS NET\nuses the best available information to assess where food assistance is “significant” (defined by at least 25 percent of\nhouseholds in a given area receiving at least 25 percent of their caloric requirements through food assistance). In\naddition, FEWS NET conducts deeper analysis of the likely impacts of food assistance on the severity of outcomes, as\ndetailed in FEWS NET’s guidance on Integrating Humanitarian Food Assistance into Scenario Development.\nAnnex 3: Seasonal calendar\nAnnex 4: Events that would likely change projected acute food insecurity outcomes\nWhile FEWS NET’s projections are considered the “most likely” scenario, there is always a degree of uncertainty in the\nassumptions that underpin the scenario. This means food security conditions and their impacts on acute food security may\nevolve differently than projected. FEWS NET issues monthly updates to its projections, but decision makers need advance\ninformation about this uncertainty and an explanation of why things may turn out differently than projected. As such, the\nfinal step in FEWS NET’s scenario development process is to briefly identify key events that would result in a credible\nalternative scenario and significantly change the projected outcomes. FEWS NET only considers scenarios that have a\nreasonable chance of occurrence.\nNational\nA delay or poor distribution of rainfall in agricultural production areas: Sud, Sud-Est, Nippes, Grand'Anse, Ouest,\nArtibonite, Grand Nord.\nLikely impact on acute food insecurity outcomes: A delayed or poor distribution of rainfall between February and\nMay 2026 would compromise the timely launch of the spring agricultural season and jeopardize crop performance.\nThese consequences would result in considerable economic losses for farmers and create food shortages within\naffected communities. The livelihoods of the poorest households would likely be most severely affected, particularly\nthose dependent on the sale of labor and agricultural products to access income. This would lead to an increase in\nthe number of households in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) in areas vulnerable to natural disasters\nsuch as the southern peninsula, the Ouest, and to food insecurity such as the Nord Ouest.\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 10\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nAnnex 5: A closer look at conflict and its impacts on food security outcomes\nArmed conflict in Haiti, particularly in Port-au-Prince, Artibonite, and Figure 2\nCentre, has severe impacts on food security. This violence consists\nHeat map of violent incidents in Haiti\nof gang attacks against civilians, security forces, commercial\nestablishments, markets, and public and private institutions. Waves\nof violence have resulted in the complete devastation of downtown\nPort-au-Prince. The majority of commercial infrastructure has been\ndestroyed and looted and inhabitants have fled, relocating to other\nlocations such as Pétion-Ville, Delmas, and the airport, which are\nnot yet directly under gang control. In Artibonite, gangs are not only\nforcing agricultural populations to flee their production areas, but\nalso burning or destroying rice plantations during the growing\nseason, thus jeopardizing winter rice production.\nSince 2019, the rise of armed violence in Haiti has transformed into\na prolonged conflict, pitting state forces against organized armed\ngroups, the best known of which is the organization called \"Viv\nansanm.\" This grouping of gangs, once rivals, now agrees to\nexercise almost total control over the ZMPP (90 percent). In\n2025, their presence has consolidated in the Ouest, Artibonite (Saint-Marc, Petite-Rivière-de-l'Artibonite, Verrettes,\nL'Estère, Gros-Morne, Marchand-Dessalines, Liancourt), Centre, and in communes of the Nord-Ouest, such as Bassin\nBleu, Chansolme, and others (Figure 2).\nApproximately 200 gangs are armed in Haiti, with varied claims and objectives. These groups find their origin in\nthe Haitian political landscape. Today, gangs use their illicit activities and political connections to accumulate power,\ncontrol territories, and respond to political and economic grievances.\nIOM estimates more than 1.4 million people have been internally displaced due to gang violence, an increase of\n31 percent compared to the end of 2024. These people have lost their essential livelihoods and are living on the edge\nof survival. Gangs have extended their grip toward Centre and Artibonite, causing violence, forced displacement, and\ndisruptions to livelihoods, markets, and trade in these regions. In addition to population movements and their direct\nimpact on food security conditions, the effects of conflict are manifested on agricultural production and economic\naccess. The spring 2025 agricultural season recorded yields below the five-year average, particularly in the Artibonite\nvalley and the southern peninsula, where violence and limited access to inputs reduced cultivated areas, according to\na FEWS NET Markets and Trade analysis.\nInsecurity on commercial routes prevents the typical movement of people and goods. Transporters who use national\nroads despite the insecurity risks must pay illegal taxes at variable rates to gang members, increasing their\noperational costs. Other traders and individuals are forced to resort to maritime transport to avoid armed gang\nattacks. As a result, public transport costs for individuals and traders are increasing, and by extension, the prices of\nbasic commodities. This is particularly evident in the Ouest department and the ZMPP, where main access routes are\nunder the control of armed gangs, preventing local and imported products from supplying major urban markets and\nhouseholds from carrying out their income-earning activities related to petty trade and daily/casual labor. This\nreduces the economic and physical access of poor households who, to cope with this situation, must resort to\nnegative consumption and livelihood coping strategies.\nPersistent restrictions on the main routes around Port-au-Prince will continue to hinder trade between the capital\nand the rest of the country. Population displacements will likely continue in Artibonite, Centre, and the ZMPP. This\ndynamic is expected to continue from October 2025 to May 2026, given the weakness of the state response to armed\ngangs. Thus, armed conflict and security deterioration will continue to be the main drivers of food insecurity in Haiti.\nTheir cumulative effects on production, markets, and humanitarian access are maintaining Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and\nEmergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes for millions of people. Without security improvements or increased humanitarian\nsupport, this situation is at risk of extending beyond May 2026.\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network 11\n\nFood Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nRecommended citation: FEWS NET.

Several municipalities\nwere temporarily isolated, severely restricting humanitarian access. Families were displaced and sought refuge in schools\nand churches, while healthcare services in Sud, Grand’Anse, and Petit-Goâve were disrupted due to limited access. The\ncontamination of water sources has heightened the risk of waterborne disease outbreaks, including cholera and acute\nwatery diarrhea, and severe agricultural losses are expected to further worsen food insecurity. Rapid assessments are\nunderway, with inter-agency needs evaluations planned by the end of November.\nUNICEF Response\nWASH\nIn the South, 2,900 hygiene kits have been prepositioned to support approximately 14,500 people. So far, 1,100 kits\nhave already been distributed to the DGPC in Grand’Anse, Nippes, and Petit-Goâve, and an additional 1,000 kits are\nscheduled for delivery next week in the South and Petit-Goâve. A WASH and cholera assessment was carried out in\nthe South-East in coordination with local authorities, leading to the launch of a contingency response. This response\nincludes the provision of 3 metric tons of calcium hypochlorite (HTH), 1.2 million water purification tablets, 15 pool testers,\nand 50 DPD1 units, which are reagents used for chlorine testing. Meanwhile, a rapid WASH and cholera assessment is\nongoing in Palmes and Petit-Goâve, where water sources have been contaminated by mudslides.\nHealth\nMedical supplies have been pre-positioned for rapid deployment by Ministry of Public Health and Population (MPSS),\ncomplemented by ongoing coordination with the Emergency Medical Team to ensure continuity of health services.\nThe Regional Office is also supporting the provision of AWD and Inter-Agency Emergency Health Kits for primary\nhealthcare facilities, while monitoring the readiness and mobilization of medical teams.\nIn addition, medical supplies have already been distributed to support the treatment of approximately 5,000 people in\nPetit-Goâve and Aquin, strengthening immediate case management capacity at peripheral health facilities. Further\ninterventions include replenishment of trauma and essential medicines kits, strategic support to cholera alert\n1\n\nverification, deployment of mobile health teams to underserved communes in South-East and West departments.\nNutrition\nIn anticipation of the Hurricane, 6,537 cartons of RUTF and medicines were pre-positioned in 255 health facilities\nacross Grand’Anse, Nippes, South, South-East, North-West and West (Croix-des-Bouquets and Léogâne) to ensure the\ncontinued treatment of children suffering from acute malnutrition for 1 to 3 months. From the 3rd to the 14th of\nNovember a technical nutrition team was deployed in the four South departments to conduct a rapid post-hurricane\nneeds assessment and supported the Health Directorates in maintaining essential nutrition services after Hurricane\nMelissa. A joint statement between UN agencies (UNICEF, FAO, PAHO, WFP) and MSPP was issued to protect and\npromote breastfeeding during the emergency. 5,357 children from 5 to 59 months were screened, with 41 SAM and\n214 MAM identified and admitted in the nutrition programme for treatment. Also, 5,300 caregivers were sensitized to key\ninfants and young child feeding practices in Emergency (IYCF-E).\nChild Protection\nUNICEF provided technical and logistical support to the Institute of Social Welfare and Research (IBESR) in the\nDamage, Loss and Needs Assessment (DLNA), the analysis of specific needs in Child Protection and the planning of\nemergency care services. Contingency and response partnerships are also being developed in departments of the\nSouth and Palmes for the provision of psychosocial support, case management, Gender Based Violence (GBV) risk\nmitigation, strengthening of foster families and targeted cash transfers for the families of children victims of Hurricane\nMelissa.\nEducation\nUNICEF supported the post-hurricane response of the Education sector both in terms of coordination and damage\nassessment of schools in the affected departments of the South and Les Palmes. 2,800 school kits were\nprepositioned and are ready for distribution pending final clearance of the Departmental Directorates of Education.\nFunding proposals are currently being prepared for school rehabilitation and re-equipping of damaged facilities.\nHumanitarian Cash Assistance\n7455 households will be supported through integrated emergency cash assistance in coordination with the World Food\nProgram (WFP). In line with OCHA standards, each household will receive USD 192 - USD 100 from WFP and USD\n92 from UNICEF.\nCommunication with Communities\nMore than 83,000 preventive awareness messages were disseminated via SMS and WhatsApp, in collaboration with\nIOM, WFP, OCHA, and DGPC, as well as through the U-Report platform. Coordination efforts are underway to\nharmonize content and ensure coherent, targeted dissemination.\nHumanitarian leadership & coordination\nSince October 22, daily high-level coordination has been led by the Humanitarian Coordinator, Direction Générale de la\nProtection Civile (DGPC), and United Nations lead agencies. UNICEF has taken an active role in coordinating the\nclusters for WASH, Health, Nutrition, Education, Child Protection, and Social Protection. Furthermore,\ncontingency partnership agreements have been activated with several organizations, including HEKS-EPER in\nGrand’Anse, ACCODEP in the South, and Plan Haiti in the South-East. A partnership with AVSI for cash transfer\nmonitoring is set to be launched in the coming days.\nFunding requirements\nTo sustain and scale up the response, UNICEF is engaging partners to secure timely and flexible funding that addresses\nimmediate needs while supporting rapid recovery. The UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated\nUS$1.2 million for anticipatory actions, including early warning systems, cash assistance, and prepositioning of supplies.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government has contributed US$2.5 million toward the Multi-sectoral Emergency Response.\nComplimenting this efforts, private sector fundraising is progressing, while UNICEF Haiti continuous to update needs\nassessments to mobilize additional resources required to meet evolving priorities and ensure that no child is left behind.\nWho to contact for Geetanjali Narayan Yannig Dussart Boris Matous\nfurther information: Representative Deputy Representative Chief Emergency, a.i.\nHaiti Country Office Haiti Country Office Haiti Country Office\nTel: +509 3996 4478 Tel: +509 4774 0011 Tel: + 509 4720 2481\nEmail: gnarayan@unicef.org Email: ydussart@unicef.org Email: bmatous@unicef.org\n2",

There is a critical need for\nhumanitarian funding to rebuild essential infrastructure; respond to the escalating health\ncrises; and ensure the provision of food, clean water, shelter, healthcare, and protection\nservices for people affected.\nUNFPA is urgently addressing the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and protection\nneeds of affected women and girls. With support to 13 health facilities and three mobile\nclinics, UNFPA and its partners have delivered critical SRH services to 1,350 people.\nUNFPA is empowering communities through six women and girls’ safe spaces and\ntargeted outreach programmes. Through these efforts, 1,659 individuals have received\nvital support, including information on the prevention of gender-based violence (GBV) and\nservices available to survivors.\n4.1 million 1.4 million 58,900 1.86 million 814,000\nTotal peop le Women of Estimated preg nant People targeted w/ People targeted w/\naffected1 reproductive age2 women2 SRH services GBV programmes\n1 ECHO.

The Caribbean - Hurricane Melissa Update.\n2 Estimated figures are based on the Minimum Initial Services Package (MISP) for Sexual and Reproductive Health in\nHumanitarian Settings calculator.\n\nUNFPA REGIONAL SITUATION REPORT I HURRICANE MELISSA I 8 - 18 NOVEMBER 2025\nRegional Situation Overview\nHurricane Melissa has caused extensive human and material losses across the Caribbean region.\nImmediate humanitarian needs remain critical. However, the delivery of essential humanitarian\nassistance is hindered by widespread infrastructure damage, blocked and flooded roads, and the fact that\nmany affected communities are in remote and difficult to access areas.\nStagnant floodwaters combined with damaged infrastructure have also created sanitation issues, raising\nthe risk of infectious disease outbreaks. In Cuba, health risks are compounded by existing outbreaks of\narboviral diseases, which are particularly high-risk for pregnant women and their babies.\nHealth services, including SRH, have been disrupted, especially in the hardest-hit areas. In Cuba, more\nthan 600 health facilities were affected by Hurricane Melissa. In Jamaica, five major hospitals suffered\nsevere damage, and about 40% of all health facilities are still facing power instability. These challenges\nhave strained the health system; making it difficult to maintain medical supplies, for communities to\naccess timely care, and ensure the continuity of critical services such as emergency obstetric care and\nprenatal check-ups.\nCurrently, 5,064 people still remain in shelters across Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba. Many of these\nfacilities—originally intended for short-term use—are operating with limited resources, and are struggling\nto meet essential needs such as clean water and menstrual hygiene supplies. Thousands of women and\ngirls are living in conditions that lack adequate privacy, security, and separate sanitation facilities. These\ngaps increase their vulnerability to GBV and exploitation, particularly those residing alone, pregnant\nwomen, adolescent girls, and survivors of prior violence, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced\nprotection measures.\nResponse efforts are focused on rebuilding health systems, supporting people who have been evacuated\nor displaced, preventing further disease outbreaks, and strengthening long-term resilience. With the\nhumanitarian response in the Caribbean projected to cost tens of millions of US dollars, a significant\nincrease in funding will be required to meet current and emerging needs.\n\nUNFPA REGIONAL SITUATION REPORT I HURRICANE MELISSA I 8 - 18 NOVEMBER 2025\nUNFPA Response\nUNFPA continues to actively contribute to inter-agency coordination efforts, supporting Humanitarian\nCoordinators and working closely with UN Country Teams to ensure that SRH and GBV priorities are fully\nintegrated into the collective response to Hurricane Melissa. UNFPA also contributes to joint analysis,\nplanning and decision-making processes across clusters and thematic working groups, helping ensure\ncoherence between national priorities, inter-agency strategies and field-level implementation.\nIn Haiti, three UNFPA funded mobile clinics delivered SRH and GBV services to 1,281 people displaced by\nthe hurricane, including 26 pregnant women and eight breastfeeding mothers. In Jamaica, UNFPA\nprovided integrated SRH and GBV services at a displacement shelter, reaching 55 women and adolescent\ngirls with vital healthcare and information.\nIn Haiti and Jamaica, UNFPA conducted awareness-raising sessions on GBV with 1,585 community\nmembers affected by Hurricane Melissa. These sessions aim to prevent GBV and ensure that survivors are\ninformed about available support services and how to access them. Following the sessions, UNFPA\ndistributed 971 dignity kits to women and adolescent girls, as well as 160 mama kits to new mothers,\nprioritizing those who were displaced and most in need.\nIn Cuba, assessments have been conducted in affected areas, and the distribution of 40 inter-agency\nreproductive health (IARH) kits, and contraceptives—which include 10,000 IUDs, and 4,200 subdermal\nimplants—is underway. Additionally, 650 dignity kits have been provided to health authorities for\ndistribution to women and girls.\nUNFPA and its implementing partners also continued to ensure that the women and girls have access to\npsychosocial support through the existing women and girls’ safe spaces and GBV services points. In Haiti\nand Jamaica, UNFPA provided counselling and psychosocial support to 442 women and girls affected by\nHurricane Melissa.\nRegional Results Snapshot\n1,350 13\nPeople reached with SRH services Health facilities supported\n1,659 6\nPeople reached with GBV prevention, Safe spaces for women and\nmitigation and response activities girls supported\nNon-food items (dignity and mama Women and girls received\nkits) distributed to individuals psychosocial support\n\nUNFPA REGIONAL SITUATION REPORT I HURRICANE MELISSA I 8 - 18 NOVEMBER 2025\nHaiti\nSituation Overview\nHurricane Melissa caused substantial human and material losses across\nmultiple regions of Haiti, particularly in the departments of South,\nGrand’Anse, South-East, Nippes, West, Artibonite, and North-West. The 1,295\nstorm claimed 43 lives, and assessments undertaken by The General\nPeople reached with\nDirectorate of Civil Protection report that 18,791 houses have been\nSRH services\nflooded, 10,574 houses have been badly damaged, and 1,325 completely\n95% female, 5% male\ndestroyed, displacing affected families. Light flooding was reported at the\nhospital in Les Cayes and minor damage was observed in Jérémie and\nPort-de-Paix.\nOf the 16,000 people who initially took refuge in shelters, 1,749 still\nremain across 10 shelters. For the women and girls who have lost\n1,229\neverything in the hurricane, there is a high need for hygiene and sanitary\nitems. However, significant shortages of tailored dignity and hygiene kits, People reached with\nas well as challenges with the transportation of items is hindering GBV prevention,\nmitigation and response\ndistributions. In addition, psychosocial support, and access to financial\nactivities\nassistance and livelihood support so they can get back on their feet is\n81% female, 19% male\ncritical.\nOf major concern is a severe deficit in holistic care and the referral\nsystem of GBV cases in hospitals in the affected areas. The lack of\ninformation, liaison teams, and specialized services, as well as access\ndifficulties due to security, logistical, and financial reasons, is\ncompromising survivors' access to quality care. A 70% funding shortfall 10\nfor GBV interventions as part of the overall humanitarian response in Health facilities\nHaiti is severely limiting the availability and quality of medical treatment, supported\npsychological support, and legal services to protect, treat, and support\nsurvivors of GBV.\nUNFPA Response\n4\nSexual and reproductive health: In collaboration with implementing\npartners, Centre for Development and Health (CDS), and Women in Safe spaces for women\nAssociation for the Development of Haiti and for the Strengthening of and girls supported\nSocial Integration (FADHRIS), three UNFPA funded mobile clinics\ndelivered SRH and GBV services at temporary shelters in Julie Meyotte\nand Gâté. A total of 1,281 people displaced by the hurricane – including\n26 affected pregnant women and eight breastfeeding women – received\nservices. In addition, 14 deliveries were recorded in UNFPA-supported\nhealth facilities, of which six required emergency cesarean sections. 74\nWomen and girls received\nGender-based violence: As the lead agency for the GBV Sub-Group,\npsychosocial support\nUNFPA coordinates closely with members, and provides regular technical\nadvice to the Humanitarian Coordinator and the UN Country Team.\n\nUNFPA REGIONAL SITUATION REPORT I HURRICANE MELISSA I 8 - 18 NOVEMBER 2025\nUNFPA and implementing partners established GBV service points in affected communities and new\ndisplacement sites to address the absence of counseling or support for survivors of violence. A total of 74\nwomen and girls received counseling and psychosocial support. Of these, 23 were referred to safe and\ntemporary accommodation due to their houses destroyed or severely damaged by Hurricane Melissa.\nIn collaboration with women’s organization FADHRIS and LGBTQI+ organization SEROvie, awareness\nraising sessions on GBV services and how to access them were held with approximately 1,155 people –\n80% who were women and girls at reproductive age – in Marie César - Pétion-Ville, Argentine Bellegarde,\nPort-au-Prince, Espas Lwazi Timoun and Ecole Mixte de la Grâce. After the sessions, UNFPA distributed\n618 dignity kits to women and adolescent girls and 160 mama kits to new mothers.\n\nUNFPA REGIONAL SITUATION REPORT I HURRICANE MELISSA I 8 - 18 NOVEMBER 2025\nJamaica\nSituation Overview\nHurricane Melissa is the worst climate disaster in Jamaica’s history,\naffecting around 1.6 million people. Authorities have confirmed 45 deaths,\nwith nearly 36,000 people in immediate need of food aid. Over 100,000 55\nhomes have been damaged, and 31% of the population still remain cut off\nPeople reached with\nfrom electricity and telecommunications.3\nSRH services\nEssential health services have been severely disrupted due to damaged\nhealth facilities (including maternity wards), power outages, and fuel\nshortages. This limits access to life-saving SRH services and maternal\nand newborn care. The Ministry of Health and Wellness is intensifying\nefforts to strengthen maternal and child health services, ensuring that\npregnant and breastfeeding women receive the medical care and 430\nessential supplies needed for safe pregnancies and the healthy\nPeople reached with\ndevelopment of newborns.\nGBV prevention,\nmitigation and response\nCurrently, 97 shelters still remain open, hosting a total of 1,296 people. activities\nAdolescent girls in the affected parishes west of the island, reported\nfeeling unsafe in shelters, as overcrowding and the absence of proper\nlighting has increased the risk of sexual violence. A significant\nhumanitarian gap exists in the implementation of proactive risk\nmitigation strategies for at-risk populations in shelters. In addition,\ncritical, multi-sectoral GBV services are limited or inaccessible due to\n3\nfacility damage and displacement, hindering the provision of clinical,\nHealth facilities\npsychosocial, and legal support to GBV survivors. Immediate funding is\nsupported\nrequired to establish minimum standards for GBV prevention and\nresponse in Jamaica.\nUNFPA Response\nSexual and reproductive health: UNFPA is actively engaged in the 2\nHealth Technical Working Group led by the World Health Organization to\nSafe spaces for women\nensure that SRH is fully integrated into the broader health sector\nand girls supported\nresponse, as well as shares information on SRH response activities to\navoid duplication of efforts.\nTogether with Caribbean Technical Assistance and Education Centre\n(C-TECH) and the University Hospital of West Indies, UNFPA supported an\nintegrated SRH/GBV information and service provision at the Petersfield\n368\nshelter. A total of 55 women and adolescent girls were reached with\nWomen and girls received\ncritical SRH services and information.4\npsychosocial support\n3 Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management in Jamaica.\n4 Jamaica Observer.

UNFPA\nalso joined the Ministry of Health and\nWellness to assess the impact of the\nhurricane, especially on maternal and child\nhealth services at Black River Hospital. First\nresponder psychosocial sessions were also\nheld with staff, given their increased\nworkloads, having witnessed distressing\nscenes, and providing care to people living in\ndesperate conditions, whilst they themselves\nare also personally impacted.\nGender-based violence: UNFPA is\nsupporting inter-agency coordination on GBV\nwith UN Women, and joined joint\nassessments with other agencies, deploying a\nGBViE Specialist to the Rapid Needs\nAssessment Team in the first days after the\nhurricane.\nTogether with the Bureau of Gender Affairs;\nthe Ministry of Culture, Gender, Entertainment\nand Sport; and C-TECH, UNFPA visited two\nsafe spaces for women and girls (Women’s\nCentre of Jamaica Foundation of Savannah la\nMar, and the Treasure Beach Women’s\nGroup), HIV clinics, and the Cornwall Regional\nHospital, as part of the gender-based\nviolence in emergencies (GBViE)\nprogramming. During the visits, UNFPA\nconducted GBV awareness sessions with 430\npeople, which aimed to prevent GBV and\nensure that survivors know where to access\nhelp. Psychosocial support was also provided\nto improve the wellbeing of those affected by\nthe hurricane. In addition, 353 dignity kits were distributed to women and adolescent girls at the\nemergency shelters to ensure they had basic health and hygiene supplies, and information on available\nGBV support services.\nA GBViE Specialist from the UNFPA Global Emergency Response Team was deployed to Jamaica to\nsupport the scale-up of the GBV response and reinforce emergency operations The Specialist is\nproviding technical assistance to implementing partners, and strengthening GBV response systems.\n\nUNFPA REGIONAL SITUATION REPORT I HURRICANE MELISSA I 8 - 18 NOVEMBER 2025\nCuba\nSituation Overview\nJust over two weeks after Hurricane Melissa passed, 53,000 people remain evacuated, including 2,019 in\nshelters, due to damage to their homes. Approximately 150,000 houses in eastern Cuba have been\naffected, with 2,300 of these completely destroyed.5 In Santiago de Cuba province, housing damage is\nparticularly severe, with 63% of the affected houses located there. In addition, nearly 60% of Santiago de\nCuba province remains without electricity, with healthcare centres having to rely on generators.\nRecent heavy rainfall and flooding in the provinces of Granma and Holguín have forced additional\nevacuations, and are complicating recovery in those areas. Basic services, housing, and critical\ninfrastructure have experienced severe damage. Collapsed bridges or blocked roads are isolating some\ncommunities and causing delays to the restoration of basic services.\nAdding to this complex scenario are recent outbreaks of different types of arboviral diseases, including\noropouche virus, dengue, and chikungunya. The heavy rains and floodwaters have created breeding\ngrounds for infected mosquitoes and health authorities estimate that 30% of Cuba’s population has\nrecently suffered from arboviral disease. Pregnant women and their babies are at high risk due to\nlife-threatening and irreversible adverse outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and congenital\nabnormalities. Due to this, pregnant women require urgent hospitalization if infected.\nUNFPA Response\nSexual and reproductive health: UNFPA participated in joint assessments with the UN Country Team and\nis engaged in the health and shelter coordination structures alongside other UN agencies.\nUNFPA also conducted a field mission to Santiago de Cuba province, visiting health centres and\ncommunities affected by Hurricane Melissa. The team met with government officials and representatives\nfrom the Ministry of Public Health, as well as pregnant women and healthcare workers, to identify the most\nurgent needs. During visits to the Maternity Homes6 in the El Cobre community, the Provincial Maternity\nHome, and the Southern Maternity Home, discussions with healthcare staff allowed for the identification of\nthe main needs for medications, contraceptives, and supplies in these primary healthcare institutions.\nIn response, UNFPA is in process of distributing 10,000 IUDs and 4,200 subdermal implants for family\nplanning, and 40 IARH kits which contain supplies for managing childbirth care and complications, the\nclinical management of sexual violence, and treatment of STIs, to the municipalities of the four affected\nprovinces. Acquisition of additional IARH kits, including 12 anti-shock garments7 is also underway. A need\nfor 504 dignity kits for all pregnant women in the Maternity Homes was also identified, and UNFPA\nsupplied the public health authorities in Santiago de Cuba province with 650 dignity kits for distribution.\n5 OCHA, Cuba, Hurricane Melissa: Flash Update No. 7. 14 November, 2025.\n6 Maternity Homes are primary healthcare institutions located in communities. They can be considered an intermediate step\nbetween the health centre and the hospital. Pregnant women stay in them to improve their nutritional status, address social needs,\nbe close to hospital facilities, and receive rest or outpatient medical treatment.\n7 The Non-pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment (NASG) reduces maternal mortality by decreasing blood flow to the uterus and\nstabilizing women in hypovolemic shock. It can keep a woman with postpartum hemorrhage alive for up to 48 hours—compared\nto about 30 minutes without intervention—providing crucial time to transfer the patient to a hospital and initiate definitive\ntreatment.\n\nUNFPA REGIONAL SITUATION REPORT I HURRICANE MELISSA I 8 - 18 NOVEMBER 2025\nRegional Funding Status\nUNFPA is appealing for US$9.93 million for the\nHurricane Melissa response. This includes\nUS$7 million for Jamaica, US$1.37 million for\nHaiti, and US$1.56 million for Cuba.\nCurrently, only US$250,000 has been provided\nthrough the UNFPA Humanitarian Thematic\nFund and US$136,000 of in-kind support has\nbeen provided by Canada.\nAdditional funding is urgently needed to\naddress the scale of the crisis and ensure that\nthe health and protection needs of women and\ngirls are not forgotten during this emergency.\n“During this hurricane, one little hole initially appeared in the\nceiling and then everything just disappeared. We did not expect\nanything like that to happen - it's a hospital, so we expected to\nbe safe. The experience is not something that I wish for anyone;\nit was traumatizing. But the nurses were there for us and helped\nus throughout all of that. They're our mothers - that's what we\ncall them. They are here assisting us in every way they can.”\n— Julia, who is pregnant with her first child, was at Cornwall Hospital in Jamaica when Hurricane\nMelissa hit.

While markets remained\noperational in many areas, access was severely\nlimited for a portion of the population, leading to\nreduced consumer activity and losses in perishable\ngoods. These disruptions undermined local food\nsystems and heightened food insecurity in\ncommunities already facing fragile conditions. The\nhurricane also triggered a wave of internal\ndisplacement, with many households losing shelter\nand livelihoods, prompting a growing desire to\nmigrate in search of safety and essential services.\nThe storm further exposed critical gaps in water,\nsanitation, and healthcare infrastructure. Many\nhouseholds rely on unsafe water sources and lack\naccess to basic sanitation, increasing the risk of\ndisease outbreaks. Health facilities are\nunderequipped, financially inaccessible for many,\nand unable to provide mental health support. As a\nresult, preventable illnesses and malnutrition are\non the rise, particularly among children and\npregnant women. Vulnerable groups—including\nwomen, girls, and youth—face heightened\nprotection risks, including exploitation and\nviolence. The departments of Nippes, Grand’Anse,\nand Sud have been particularly affected,\nunderscoring the urgent need for coordinated\nhumanitarian action and long-term resilience\nstrategies to stabilize communities and restore\nessential services.\n\nFOOD SECURITY AND HOUSEHOLD VULNERABILITY IN THE WAKE OF\nHURRICANE MELISSA\nBefore Melissa\nFOOD CONSUMPTION\nHouseholds in communes affected by Hurricane\nMelissa have experienced a sharp deterioration in\nfood security, as reflected by a significant rise in poor\nFood Consumption Scores. Post-storm assessments\nshow an increase of over 20 points in these scores,\nindicating a substantial decline in dietary diversity\nand meal frequency. This surge highlights the\ndeepening crisis in areas already struggling with\nfragile food systems and limited access to nutritious\nfood.\nFCS Before Melissa VS After\nFCS National level : FCS: Prioritized Melissa in prioritized communes\nnon Prioritized) communes\nPoor Limit Acceptable\nacceptable\nacc 3 e 5 p .1 t % able 3 P 0 o .6 o % r 25.6% Poor Before Melissa 26% 59% 15% After Melissa\n36.6%\nAfter Melissa 48% 45%\n3 li 4 m .3 i % t 3 L 7 im .7 i % t 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nWFP,mVAM 2025\nThe worsening consumption patterns underscore the\nhurricane’s impact on household resilience and\ncoping capacity. With local markets disrupted and\nlivelihoods severely affected, families are increasingly\nunable to meet basic nutritional needs. This trend not\nonly signals immediate humanitarian concerns but\nalso points to long-term risks for health,\ndevelopment, and stability in the most vulnerable\ncommunities.\nREDUCED COPING STRATEGIES\nFollowing Hurricane Melissa, food security in Haiti has sharply deteriorated, as evidenced by a rise in high-\nlevel food coping strategies among affected households. The proportion of families resorting to extreme\nmeasures—such as skipping meals, reducing portion sizes, or relying on less nutritious foods—\nincreased from 9% to 16%. This escalation is particularly pronounced in the departments of Nippes,\nGrand’Anse and Sud, where the storm’s impact was most severe.

Members are\nselected through participatory meetings and must not benefit from the assistance. Each committee signs an\nagreement outlining roles and responsibilities.\nStep 3: Committee Orientation\nCommittee members are trained on their roles, emphasizing transparency, impartiality, and voluntary\nparticipation. They are reminded that assistance is free and no compensation can be requested from\nbeneficiaries.\nStep 4: Establishing Targeting Criteria\nTwo categories of criteria are used:\nCategory 1: Households affected by Melissa (e.g., loss of income, damaged homes, displaced)\nCategory 2: Socioeconomic vulnerability (e.g., female-headed households, rural location, disability,\npoor housing) Eligibility requires meeting at least one shock-related criterion and three vulnerability\ncriteria, or being displaced in a shelter.\nStep 5: Household Listing and Validation\nCommittees compile household lists based on agreed criteria. WFP verifies a random sample (15%)—lists\nare validated if 80% meet the criteria. Final lists are signed by all involved during the community validation\nprocess.\nMETHODOLOGY APPROACH\nThis analysis is based primarily on real-time data collected between July and October 31, 2025. A total of\n350 household surveys were conducted from October 1 to 31, enabling the calculation of key indicators\nboth before and after the crisis, including the Food Consumption Score (FCS), Coping Strategies Index (CSI),\nand Household Hunger Scale (HHS).\nIn addition, a rapid multisectoral assessment (MSA) was carried out immediately following Hurricane\nMelissa. This assessment included focus group discussions across 18 prioritized communes, particularly in\nthe departments of Grand’Anse, Nippes, and Sud. The main objectives of the MSA were to:\nUnderstand the living conditions of affected households\nIdentify their most urgent needs\nDetermine the necessity for targeted support to the most vulnerable groups\nRecommend the most appropriate forms of assistance\nIt is important to note that the assessment did not include an agricultural component and therefore does\nnot evaluate the hurricane’s impact on the agricultural sector.\nWanja KAARIA, Country Director\nErwan RUMEN , Deputy Country Director\nTechnical Team:\nTelesphore OUEDRAOGO, Head of RAM unit\nWilfried CHIGBLO, VAM Officer\nContact: telesphore.ouedraogo@wfp.org",

Poor\nhouseholds face a combination of crop losses, atypically high\nfood prices, and persistent insecurity, leading to increased\nreliance on negative coping strategies such as reducing the\nnumber of daily meals, selling productive assets, forced\nmigration, contracting risky debt, begging, and resorting to\ninformal or high-risk mechanisms, including survival sex. FEWS\nNET estimates that between 3.0 and 3.49 million people will\nrequire food assistance between November 2025 and May\n2026, with needs peaking during the lean season (April–May).\nInsecurity continues to deteriorate in the ZMPP, Artibonite,\nand Central Plateau. Armed group activity is paralyzing\nmobility, markets, and essential services, exacerbating internal\ndisplacement affecting more than 1.4 million people, including\n210,000 in the ZMPP. According to PLSO, no major area is\nconsidered safe. BINUH reports 1,247 deaths, 710 injuries, 145\nkidnappings, and more than 400 cases of sexual violence\nlinked to gang activity during Q3 2025. Since September,\napproximately 45,000 people have been displaced, some\nmultiple times (CCCM).\nThe impacts of Hurricane Melissa at the end of October,\nwith rainfall totals exceeding 250 mm, have significantly\nworsened food security conditions in several regions.\nAccording to the WFP, more than 1.25 million people were\naffected in the South, Southeast, Nippes, Grand’Anse, and West\ndepartments, with over 11,900 homes flooded or damaged and\nnearly 16,000 people sheltered in temporary facilities.\nAgricultural losses are substantial, including the destruction of\nautumn crops (banana, maize, sorghum, roots and tubers,\npigeon peas) in the hardest-hit communes, damage to irrigation\ninfrastructure, and road blockages limiting market access. These\nshocks have sharply reduced food availability and household\nagricultural income.\nFood prices remain atypically high nationwide, well above the five-year average, driven by the seasonal\nabsence of harvests and crop losses from Hurricane Melissa. In hurricane-affected areas, price increases are\nparticularly pronounced. For example, yellow maize in Jérémie rose 31 percent between September and\nOctober — further constraining poor households’ economic access to food.\nFEWS NET Haiti\nFEWS NET is a United States Government-funded activity.

Displacement, disrupted essential services, and heightened health risks—particularly for\nwomen, girls, and other vulnerable populations—remain pressing concerns.\nWidespread displacement persists across the affected countries, with many people unable to return\nhome and relying on temporary shelter arrangements or community support. Overcrowding, lack of\nprivacy, and insecure conditions is increasing the risk of GBV for those displaced.\nFloodwaters have contaminated water sources and created breeding grounds for mosquitoes,\nheightening public health issues. Authorities have declared outbreaks of arboviral diseases in Cuba and\nleptospirosis in Jamaica. The risk to pregnant women is particularly concerning due to the risk of severe\nfetal complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, and neonatal death. Haiti is also\nfacing an ongoing cholera crisis, worsened by displacement and affected water and sanitation facilities.\nUNFPA Response\nSexual and reproductive health: 46 inter-agency reproductive health (IARH) kits3 were delivered to\nhealth facilities in Cuba and Haiti to support deliveries, treatment of STIs, and the clinical management\nof rape, of 7,200 people over a 3 month period.

Shelter\nsupport remains critical, along with sustained needs for food assistance,\nwater and hygiene supplies, tarpaulins, bedding, baby items, essential\nmedical products, and materials for temporary housing repairs.\nRestoration of critical services continues but remains uneven.\n3\nApproximately 144,000 households are still without power, while around\nSafe Spaces for women\n96,000 households lack reliable piped supply. Water trucking continues in\nand girls supported\nthe hardest-hit areas, delivering roughly 100,000 gallons per day. These\nservice gaps are prolonging displacement and daily hardship, limiting\nhygiene practices and food storage, and slowing the reopening of health\nfacilities, and small businesses.\nHealth concerns remain a major issue. The Ministry of Health and Wellness has confirmed an active\nleptospirosis outbreak, with 45 suspected cases, 18 confirmed cases, and 12 deaths. The parishes of St.\nJames, St. Ann, and St. Elizabeth are among the most affected. The risk of fetal\ncomplications—including miscarriage and stillbirth—poses a significant concern for pregnant women,\nparticularly during the first and second trimesters. Ongoing response efforts include mobile clinics,\nenvironmental health inspections, risk-communication campaigns, water safety guidance, and\npsychological first aid.\nUNFPA Response\nSexual and Reproductive Health:\nThe UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has provided support for the deployment of a\nsexual and reproductive health in emergencies (SRHiE) specialist to join the UNFPA team in Jamaica to\nsupport the scale-up of the SRH response and reinforce emergency operations. The specialist is\nproviding technical assistance to implementing partners, and strengthening SRH response systems.\nGender-based violence:\nUNFPA, in collaboration with its partners, conducted GBV awareness sessions and services in two\nlocations of Trelawny and Westmoreland. A total of 414 individuals (164 and 250 respectively) were\nprovided with information about services available, as well as received group and individual\npsychosocial support. From the participants, 10 women and adolescent girls were identified as highly\nvulnerable and received UNFPA dignity kits. The activities were organized in partnership with the Bureau\nof Gender Affairs, Jamaican Constabulary Force, and other GBV actors such as the Women Center of\nUNFPA United Nations Population Fund\n\nUNFPA Regional Situation Report I Hurricane Melissa I 19 - 30 November 2025\nJamaica Foundation (WCJF), Child Protection and Family Services Agency (CPFSA), and the Ministry of\nJustice.\nUNFPA, UN Women and UNICEF collaborated on a One UN effort to deliver a joint awareness session on\nthe protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) for the Jamaica Defense Force and key first\nresponders from the Office of the Prime Minister.\nSpecialists from the UNFPA Global Emergency Response Team (GERT) also facilitated a webinar\norganized by the Ministry of Health and Wellness on GBV, interpersonal violence, the clinical\nmanagement of rape, and mental health and psychosocial support for survivors, reaching 104 health\ncare workers.\nOn 28 November, UNFPA chaired the third GBV Sub Working Group to promote coordinated information\nsharing and prioritization of GBV protection needs across the humanitarian response. The session\nincluded updates on the GBV service mapping, and the launch of an online gender-based violence in\nemergencies (GBViE) capacity assessment survey to inform the development of a capacity-building\nstrategy.\nAdolescents and Youth:\nDuring a visit to Peterville, UNFPA engaged adolescent girls on their situation and created awareness on\nGBV. Discussion also focused on understanding their needs, ranging from health, physical survival,\npsychological recovery, and protection from harm. A total of 15 girls attended the session.\nDuring the Ms and Mr Jamaica event, UNFPA raised awareness on roles of young people, GBV and SRH\namong youth in the contexts of the post Hurricane Melissia and on prioritizing safe and meaningful\nparticipation, empowerment of young people - including boys, on behavioral change for broader GBV\nprevention efforts, and information on GBV helpline. Over 150 people attended the event, including 51\ngirls, 47 boys, 28 women and 24 men.\nUNFPA United Nations Population Fund\n\nUNFPA Regional Situation Report I Hurricane Melissa I 19 - 30 November 2025\nCuba\nSituation Overview\nThe recovery efforts in the affected areas are still underway, with the\nNational Defense Council in charge of allocating resources and donations.\nAccess to energy has improved, mainly in urban areas.\n18,150\nThe government decided to return to normal operations in the provinces of\nPeople reached with\nHolguín, Granma, and Guantánamo, while the province of Santiago de Cuba\nSRH services\nremains in a recovery phase under the direction of the Provincial Defense 79% female, 21% male\nCouncil and its municipal and zonal defense councils. The provinces that\nhave returned to normal operations will continue reconstruction efforts with\nthe support of administrative structures, local organizations, and the\nparticipation of the population.\nThe epidemiological situation remains challenging, with an increase in\narboviruses in the affected territories. An increase in febrile syndromes is\n41\nreported in seven provinces, including three of the eastern provinces of the\nHealth facilities\ncountry: Las Tunas, Holguín and Granma. The Ministry of Public Health has\nsupported\ndeveloped an updated care protocol with a specific focus on pregnant\nwomen and newborns.\nUNFPA Response\nOperating under the Health and Shelter Clusters, and working in close\ncollaboration with the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) and Federation of 2\nCuban Women, UNFPA continues to support the emergency response,\nSafe Spaces for women\nensuring the SRH and GBV needs are being met in communities affected\nand girls supported\nby Hurricane Melissa.\nSexual and reproductive health:\nUNFPA continued to identify the most urgent needs of individuals and health facilities regarding\nmedicines and supplies, supporting the procurement and distribution of essential health\ncommodities, such as IARH kits and contraceptives. These have been delivered to the affected\nprovinces, following a visit to the area conducted alongside the Ministry of Foreign Trade and MoH\nto meet with health personnel and other key stakeholders.\nA total of 650 hygiene kits were distributed to pregnant and postpartum women at maternal health\nfacilities in Santiago de Cuba province. In addition, 10,000 IUDs were delivered to family planning\nservices, and 40 IARH kits—which will service 6,200 people—arrived at health facilities in\nHolguin, Granma, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo.\nGender-based violence:\nAn Inter-Agency Working Group was activated, with the participation of MoH, UNFPA and other UN\nagencies, to optimize needs identification and complementarities in procurement. A key\ncomponent of the response was UNFPA's active advocacy for the inclusion of the PSEA in the\ninter-agency response, which led to the identification of two spaces in the affected territories to\naddress PSEA and GBV needs; the creation of strategic alliances with the Pan American Health\nOrganization (PAHO) and UNDP for a more comprehensive response; the production and\ndistribution of key informative materials on PSEA; and the sensitization of service personnel.\nUNFPA United Nations Population Fund\n\nUNFPA Regional Situation Report I Hurricane Melissa I 19 - 30 November 2025\nUNFPA, in its role as the lead agency of the Inter-Agency Working Group for PSEA is supporting two\nsafe spaces for the provision of services for GBV care and prevention. A working meeting was held with\nthe Federation of Cuban Women to select additional safe spaces and identify the actions to be\nimplemented.\nIn coordination with the Federation of Cuban Women and the National Union of Jurists of Cuba, UNFPA\nalso updated informational materials on sexual exploitation and abuse—including the availability of\nservices—which are being reproduced for distribution in communities and service centres in the\nprovince of Santiago de Cuba where the hurricane response is being implemented.\nRegional Funding Status\nUNFPA is appealing for US$9.93 million for the\nHurricane Melissa response. This includes US$7\nmillion for Jamaica, US$1.37 million for Haiti,\nand US$1.56 million for Cuba.\nCurrently, only US$250,000 has been provided\nthrough the UNFPA Humanitarian Thematic\nFund and US$136,000 of in-kind support has\nbeen provided by Canada.\nAdditional funding is urgently needed to\naddress the scale of the crisis and ensure that\nthe health and protection needs of women and\ngirls are not forgotten during this emergency.\nCurrent Donors For more information\n● UNFPA Emergency Fund / Susana Sottoli\nHumanitarian Thematic Fund Regional Director\nsottoli@unfpa.org\n● Government of Canada\n● UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Norha Restrepo (Media Enquiries)\nDevelopment Office Regional Communications Advisor\nnrestrepo@unfpa.org\nUNFPA United Nations Population Fund",

Red alert, the highest alert level, was declared for the Grand Sud\n(Sud, Grand ’Anse), Nippes, Ouest and Sud-Est, while areas such as Artibonite and Nord-Ouest were placed under\norange alert.\nAccording to the General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC), 46 people lost their lives, 250,000 people were\naffected, and approximately 840,000 structures were damaged or destroyed.\nThe departments of Sud, Grand ‘Anse, Sud-Est, Nippes, Ouest, Artibonite and Nord-Ouest were among the most\naffected. Flooding and landslides impacted homes, social infrastructure, agricultural land and irrigation systems, with\nconsequences for livelihoods and access to essential services.\nThe Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) activated its Anticipatory Action framework, enabling the mobilization\nof USD 4 million for targeted preventive interventions.\nThese actions were complemented by a post-shock humanitarian response, implemented in a context of limited\nresources and increasing needs (see Flash Update #5).\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\nCash and Transfer assistance\nWorld Vision International – Haiti provided cash assistance to 772 households in the Nippes department.\nThe RRM Consortium, through partner ACTED, implemented multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) in Belle-Anse,\ntargeting 170 households (1,223 people) in the 1st section Bais d’Orange (Bwa Kodenn, Yonbe) and the 2nd section\nMabriole (Nan Powo, Chaudry).\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to\nCoordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.\nWe advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\nwww.unocha.org\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and Norwegian Church Aid (NCA), through their Joint Office, provided cash\nassistance to 550 affected households in Petit-Goâve.\n400 households were assisted in the 1st, 11th and 12th communal sections, with an additional 150 households\nsupported in the 12th section, with financial support from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Canadian\nLutheran World Relief / Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund.\nFood Security\nWFP assisted 189,370 people in Grand ‘Anse, Sud, Nippes and Sud-Est through 1,146 metric tons of food, USD\n2.248 million in cash transfers, e-vouchers for 12,665 beneficiaries, and micro-insurance coverage for 10,650 people.\n47,465 people benefited from anticipatory actions and 137,570 people from emergency assistance.\nLWF and NCA, in collaboration with RODEP and FNGA, provided cash assistance in Petit-Goâve and Jérémie,\nreaching 700 households.\nGender-Based Violence\nFrom 15 to 31 December 2025 in Petit-Goâve, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in collaboration with\nMédecins du Monde Suisse, conducted a rapid assessment of gender-based violence (GBV) risks. A total of 796\nhouseholds were assessed (58 per cent women and 42 per cent men), and five GBV risk areas were identified. The\nmain risks reported included precarious shelter conditions, loss of livelihoods, and limited access to health services.\nHealth-related issues were also reported, including skin conditions (24 per cent of respondents), as well as reports of\nharassment (5 per cent), domestic violence (2 per cent) and sexual assault (2 per cent).\nIn response, GBV prevention and response activities were implemented in December 2025 in Gaston (2nd communal\nsection of Petit-Goâve). These included the establishment of a temporary safe space for women and girls at the Kay\nPère Numa site, as well as the deployment of GBV mobile teams. Twenty-five people received individual psychosocial\nsupport, and awareness-raising activities on available GBV services were conducted for affected communities. In\naddition, four psycho-educational and recreational activities were organized for the benefit of 175 children and\nadolescents affected by Hurricane Melissa. Furthermore, 660 women and girls received dignity kits, in coordination\nwith the Ministry for Women’s Affairs and Women’s Rights (MCFDF).\nRODEP conducted awareness-raising activities on gender-based violence, Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and\nAbuse (PSEA), and child protection, reaching 4,000 people.\nPsychological first aid was provided to 150 people, while 2,400 people benefited from psychosocial support.\nThese activities were implemented in partnership with the LWF/NCA Joint Office, with financial support from the\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America and Canadian Lutheran World Relief / Canadian Humanitarian Assistance\nFund.\nHealth\nUNICEF supported 5,846 consultations through mobile clinics for acute respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases and\nmeasles vaccination. Interagency Emergency Health Kits (IEHK) were pre-positioned and deployed to health facilities\nand mobile clinics in 29 communes in the Sud department.\nLogistics\nIn December 2025, WFP supported the transport of 205 metric tons of food, NFIs and relief items to the South for six\norganizations. In January 2026, 161 metric tons of humanitarian goods were transported by sea, mainly between the\nNorth and South, benefiting three partners. 110.5 metric tons of medical supplies and NFIs were shipped from the\nAPN port to Petit-Goâve. A mixed road and maritime operation enabled the delivery of 22 metric tons of food.\nThe Mission of Hope Foundation (FOME) transported and distributed dry food by sea from Cap-Haïtien to the Sud and\nGrand ‘Anse departments. Each household received a food kit equivalent to 72 meals. Assistance reached 159\nhouseholds in Saint-Jean-du-Sud and 2,775 households in Jérémie.\nNutrition\nIn collaboration with nutrition sector partners, UNICEF supported the screening of 10,846 children aged 6–59 months,\ntreated 302 children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and 687 children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).\n9,015 pregnant and breastfeeding women and caregivers were sensitized on Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF)\npractices.\nProtection\n200 people participated in awareness sessions on PSEA, child protection and complaints mechanisms in the 12th\ncommunal section of Petit-Goâve.42 people received individual psychosocial support, and 201 people participated in\ngroup psychosocial sessions.\n\nShelter and Non-Food Items\nShelter/NFI Cluster partners supported 4,226 households through the distribution of NFI kits and/or light shelter kits,\nincluding 3,526 households in the Grand Sud, 400 in Artibonite, and 300 in Nord-Ouest. Assistance was delivered\nthrough the IOM Common Pipeline (joint rapid response mechanism), in collaboration with partners (RANEPH,\nAPRONHA, Hope for Haiti, Caritas, MOFEDGA, ADRINA RICHESSES, CHES, ROPANIP and CORE), as well as by\nCRS/Caritas, which supported 396 households through a hybrid approach combining in-kind assistance and cash\ntransfers.\nDIAKONIE distributed 500 hygiene kits and 500 shelter kits to 500 vulnerable families in Petit-Goâve, with financial\nsupport from CLWR/CHAF and in partnership with RODEP (one of the FLM/NCA partners).\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)\nFrom 22 to 26 December 2025, IOM ensured a daily supply of safe drinking water to the Anse Rouge community,\ndelivering 60 m³ of water per day into three reservoirs. From 29 to 31 December 2025, seven water trucks, providing\nan additional 85 m³ of water, were delivered to the Anse Rouge community. The organization also trained local\ncommittees on residual chlorine monitoring in trucked water and provided them with water quality testing kits.\nLWF and NCA rehabilitated four water points in the 11th and 12th communal sections of Petit-Goâve, restoring\naccess to safe drinking water for approximately 1,000 people. Ravine correction works were carried out in the 2nd\ncommunal section of Haut Voldrogue, in the commune of Jérémie, by LWF and NCA, reducing flood risks and\ncontributing to soil conservation. As part of these activities, twelve people (seven women and five men) received two\ndays of training on personal hygiene, environmental hygiene, and DINEPA’s WAKA methodology (a community-based\nbehaviour change approach for water, sanitation and hygiene). Participants were organized into four Hygiene\nPromotion Cells (HPCs) responsible for conducting awareness-raising activities in the three targeted communities. In\naddition, 400 hygiene kits were distributed to 400 beneficiary households (272 women and 128 men).\nUNICEF repaired and rehabilitated nine hand pumps, restoring access to safe drinking water for approximately 13,250\npeople. A total of 2,050 households in Beaumont, Petit-Goâve and Anse-à-Veau received hygiene kits and\nparticipated in awareness sessions on safe water use, hygiene, diarrhoeal disease prevention, and Prevention of\nSexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA). An additional 2,000 households in Petit-Goâve received water chlorination\nproducts for household-level water treatment. UNICEF also distributed more than 2.4 million litres of safe drinking\nwater by water trucks, reaching 24,000 internally displaced persons and 20,000 vulnerable people. As part of the\ncholera response, the organization reached 25,537 people through awareness-raising activities, investigated 79\nalerts, treated 120 suspected cases, and distributed 699 cholera kits.\nRODEP distributed 400 hygiene kits to 400 households in the commune of Petit-Goâve, including 150 households in\nthe 1st section of Bino, 100 in the 11th section of Ravine Sèche, and 150 in the 12th section of Des Fourques. The\nNGO also launched the rehabilitation of four water points, including two in the 12th section, one in the 11th section,\nand one in the 1st section. In addition, hygiene promotion awareness activities were conducted for 2,270 people\n(1,640 women and 630 men). A total of 400 tap buckets and water purification tablets were procured and distributed to\n400 households.\nCoordination\nOCHA mobilized multiple humanitarian actors to support the Civil Protection Directorate in conducting the official\nDamage and Needs Assessment (EDAB) following Hurricane Melissa. As a result, most organizations aligned their\nanalyses with EDAB findings to inform response planning, limiting the use of independent assessments. In Petit-\nGoâve, OCHA facilitated coordination between local authorities and non-governmental actors to ensure a more\ncoherent and complementary response on the ground.\nContacts:\nModibo Traoré, Head of Office, OCHA : traorem@un.org\nClaire-Emmanuelle Pressoir, Public Information Officer OCHA : Claire.pressoir@un.org\nFor more information www.unocha.org, www.reliefweb.int, https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/haiti\nHumanitarian updates are also available on the OCHA WhatsApp channel:\nhttps://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va9ta4865yDKzOB9wI37",

      "body_text": "<p><em><strong>Authorities, Partners Should Prioritize Water, Sanitation, and Health Systems</strong></em></p>\n<p>(Washington, DC) – A resurgence of cholera in <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hrw.org/americas/haiti\">Haiti</a>’s West department underscores the urgent need for coordinated, long-term action to restore basic water and sanitation systems, Human Rights Watch said today. The outbreak, part of a seasonal surge during the rainy period, is spreading in and around Port-au-Prince and its metropolitan area amid the near collapse of the capital’s health infrastructure and worsening insecurity.</p>\n<p>Between January 1 and October 30, 2025, Haitian health authorities recorded 2,852 suspected cholera cases, 186 confirmed cases, and 48 deaths. Over a third of suspected cases are in children under 9, according to government data. After <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.unocha.org/news/todays-top-news-occupied-palestinian-territory-sudan-democratic-republic-congo-haiti-0\">an 11-week period</a> during which no new cases were reported, public health authorities are now seeing a resurgence of cholera.</p>\n<p>“Cholera is once again threatening thousands of lives in Haiti because people lack access to the most basic services: clean water, sanitation, and medical care,” said <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/nathalye-cotrino\">Nathalye Cotrino</a>, senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Haitians need serious government and international efforts to address the outbreak and avoid more preventable deaths.”</p>\n<p>After over three years with <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/18/haiti-urgently-address-cholera-outbreak\">no confirmed cholera cases</a>, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm7202a1-h.pdf\">infections reappeared</a> in the country at the end of September 2022. The resurgence marks a painful continuation of the country’s struggle with cholera.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Haiti’s <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14641343#:~:text=Cholera%20appeared%20in%20Haiti%20in%20October%202010%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%20recorded%20history\">first</a> cholera outbreak <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2016/sgsm18323.doc.htm\">was traced back</a> to sewage negligently released from a United Nations peacekeeping base into a river. It caused about 9,800 deaths and over 820,000 infections. In 2016, the UN <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2016/sgsm18323.doc.htm\">acknowledged</a> its role in causing the epidemic and accepted a moral, but not legal, responsibility to address it. Today, persistent gaps in sanitation, clean water access, and emergency preparedness continue to leave the population dangerously exposed to renewed outbreaks.</p>\n<p>“Stagnant water, broken sewage lines, and the accumulation of trash across the city create ideal conditions for outbreaks to spread whenever the rains come,” Diana Manilla Arroyo, Head of Mission for <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.msf.org/\">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> (MSF) Holland in Haiti, told Human Rights Watch. “On top of that, a lot of the country’s infrastructure was destroyed in the 2010 earthquake.”</p>\n<p>Lack of access to clean water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene are <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/causes/index.html\">major contributors</a> to the spread of cholera. In Haiti, only 25 per cent of households have access to adequate handwashing facilities with soap, and 70 percent of people do not have access to an improved sanitation system, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.unicef.org/haiti/en/water-sanitation-and-hygiene-wash\">according to the UN</a>. Heavy rain from <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/hurricane-melissa\">Hurricane Melissa</a> also risks spreading the bacteria to more non-chlorinated water sources.</p>\n<p>The resurgence of cholera is exacerbated by extreme insecurity. Criminal groups have <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/04/17/haiti-escalating-violence-puts-population-grave-risk\">expanded</a> their control across much of the country, blocking roads, restricting humanitarian access, and isolating communities in need. Violence <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.iom.int/news/displacement-haiti-reaches-record-high-14-million-people-flee-violence\">has displaced</a> over 1.4 million people this year, the highest number ever recorded in Haiti, forcing many into overcrowded informal settlements with little or no access to clean water or sanitation. These conditions put displaced people at serious risk.</p>\n<p>For those who fall ill, accessing health care is difficult. Only 11 percent of health facilities with inpatient capacity in the capital remain fully operational, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.unocha.org/news/todays-top-news-occupied-palestinian-territory-sudan-democratic-republic-congo-haiti-0#:~:text=This%20outbreak%20is%20unfolding%20amid%20a%20severe%20deterioration%20of%20basic%20services%20in%20the%20capital%2C%20where%20only%2011%20per%20cent%20of%20health%20facilities%20with%20inpatient%20capacity%20remain%20fully%20operational.\">according to the UN</a>. While people in more affluent and safer neighborhoods can reach private hospitals and treatment centers, those in areas controlled by criminal groups, such as Cité Soleil and lower Delmas, face severe movement restrictions, and do not have the means to pay for private health care.</p>\n<p>The latest outbreak <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/haiti-cholera-outbreak-dg-echo-dg-echo-partners-paho-unicef-ministry-public-health-and-population-echo-daily-flash-2-october-2025\">has reached</a> Pétion-Ville, a more affluent neighborhood of Port-au-Prince where most UN and diplomatic offices are located, which had largely avoided significant cholera transmission in recent years.</p>\n<p>With assistance from the Pan American Health Organization and other humanitarian partners, Haiti’s Ministry of Health <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.unocha.org/news/todays-top-news-occupied-palestinian-territory-sudan-democratic-republic-congo-haiti-0#:~:text=Haiti%E2%80%99s%20Ministry%20of%20Health%20%E2%80%93%20with%20support%20from%20the%20Pan%20American%20Health%20Organization%20and%20humanitarian%20partners%20%E2%80%93%20has%20stepped%20up%20disinfection%20campaigns%2C%20community%20awareness%20activities%2C%20and%20the%20distribution%20of%20chlorine%2C%20safe%20water%20and%20hygiene%20kits%20in%20the%20most%20affected%20neighborhoods.\">has intensified</a> efforts in the hardest-hit areas, including disinfection drives, public awareness initiatives, and the provision of chlorine, safe water, and hygiene supplies.</p>\n<p>Haiti’s transitional government, with support from international partners, should urgently repair the national water and sewage network, guarantee safe humanitarian access to high-risk areas, and restore the operational capacity of public health institutions, Human Rights Watch said. Efforts to chlorinate water sources and conduct public awareness campaigns on cholera prevention and the use of chlorinated water are also crucial, especially during high-risk seasons.</p>\n<p>Despite the worsening humanitarian and security conditions, several countries continue to return people to Haiti in large numbers, notably the Dominican Republic, the United States, and the Bahamas, as well as the British overseas territory of Turks and Caicos. These and other countries deported over 225,000 people to Haiti between January and the end of October 2025, according to the International Organization for Migration.</p>\n<p>People should not be deported or otherwise returned to Haiti, where overlapping humanitarian, security, and public health crises endanger lives, and where they face a high risk of violence with no effective access to protection or justice, Human Rights Watch said.</p>\n<p>“This cholera outbreak is being fueled by years of institutional neglect and the near collapse of essential services,” said Cotrino. “Foreign governments should be doing all they can to help Haiti put an end to cholera.”</p>\n"

South-East, Nippes, and West departments remain on orange alert, with authorities urging communities to follow official guidance and avoid high-risk areas.</p>\n<p>In the South, 124 households living in precarious areas in Les Cayes, Île-à-Vache, and Coteaux began relocating to emergency shelters on 24 October. Schools across the Grand South have suspended classes due to severe weather and their use as temporary shelters.</p>\n<p>According to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), unstable weather conditions are expected to persist, with intense rainfall, flooding, and landslides likely in coastal and mountainous areas. Already, three fatalities and one serious injury have been reported following a landslide in Fontamara, Port-au-Prince. Rivers have overflowed in multiple departments, damaging homes, roads, and critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Agricultural livelihoods are under severe threat. Heavy rains and strong winds have damaged crops, obstructed access to farmland and markets, and disrupted fishing activities along the southern coast. In Mapou (South-East), 15 hectares of maize have been lost. These impacts jeopardize the upcoming winter agricultural season and risk deepening food insecurity.</p>\n<p>According to the October 2025 IPC analysis, over 1.4 million people in the affected departments are already in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with 350,000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Without urgent intervention, the storm could push more families into deeper vulnerability.</p>\n<p>World Vision Haiti has activated its Incident Management Team (IMT) at both national and regional levels and is coordinating closely with the Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC) and humanitarian partners. Prepositioned relief supplies are ready to support 3,000 households, including hygiene kits, kitchen sets, and shelter materials. Rapid response teams are on standby to deploy as conditions allow.</p>\n<p>To meet immediate needs, World Vision Haiti has allocated USD 300,000 from its National Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund (NEPRF). The organization is actively engaging with the Partnership and donors to secure flexible, timely funding to scale up its response. Fundraising appeals will be finalized following rapid needs assessments and ongoing coordination with national authorities.</p>\n<p>“Children and families in Haiti are facing compounding crises,” said Lesly Michaud, Country Program Director. “We are committed to standing with communities through this storm and beyond, ensuring they receive the support they need to recover and rebuild.”</p>\n<p>World Vision Haiti continues to monitor the situation closely and remains focused on protecting the most vulnerable, restoring livelihoods, and supporting long-term resilience.</p>\n"

              "• Critical Humanitarian Needs\nHurricane Melissa has left a profound\nhumanitarian crisis in Haiti, affecting an estimated\n1.25 million people across 59 communes, with\n360,000 individuals already acutely food insecure\nresiding in the most severely impacted areas. The\nstorm has displaced over 16,000 people to\ntemporary shelters, destroyed homes, schools, and\ncritical infrastructure, and severely disrupted\naccess to essential services. Humanitarian teams\nare facing significant challenges reaching isolated\ncommunities due to damaged roads, and ongoing\ninsecurity, all of which complicate the delivery of\nlife-saving assistance.\n• Food Security Impact\nFood security has sharply deteriorated in the\naftermath of the hurricane. While assessments are\nunderway, mobile monitoring indicates that 40% of\nhouseholds in the hardest-hit communes now\nhave a poor food consumption score (double the\n20% pre-hurricane levels). The proportion of\nfamilies resorting to high-level negative coping\nstrategies has also risen from 9% to 16%.\nAgricultural losses are devastating, with up to 90%\nof production wiped out in some areas,\ncompounding the crisis for communities already\nclassified as IPC Phase 3 or higher."

              "Haiti - Food Security Outlook October 2025 - May 2026\nPersistent insecurity and the effects of Hurricane Melissa maintain Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and\nEmergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity\nKey Messages\nThe persistence of gang violence continues to cause forced\ndisplacement of the population, disrupt income-earning\nactivities, and affect typical market functioning. Between\nOctober 2025 and May 2026, Emergency (IPC Phase 4)\noutcomes are expected in Cité Soleil, Port-au-Prince, Croix-\ndes-Bouquets, as well as among internally displaced persons\n(IDPs) living in sites in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area\n(ZMPP). At the same time, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are\nanticipated in several departments of the country.\nAs insecurity intensifies, particularly in the ZMPP, and gang\nactivity expands into Artibonite and Centre, between 3.0 and\n3.49 million people will be in need of food assistance\nbetween October 2025 and May 2026, and peak between\nApril and May 2026.\nMore than 1.4 million IDPs are recorded in Haiti, including\napproximately 210,000 in precarious sites in the ZMPP, with\nlimited access to markets and essential services. IDPs have lost\ntheir livelihoods and depend on limited and intermittent food\nassistance.\nThe passage of Hurricane Melissa caused extensive losses of\nautumn crops and livestock across the Grand Sud( Sud, Sud-\nEst, Nippes, Grand'Anse), as well as parts of Ouest and\nArtibonite. Flooding damaged key transportation infrastructure,\nsocial facilities, and IDP shelter sites. These impacts compromise\nthe income and food access of affected households and have\nled to an increase in the number of people in need between\nNovember and December 2025.\nInflation remains high, reaching 31.9 percent, while food\ninflation exceeds 35 percent in September 2025. Prices increased\nby 1.8 percent between August and September 2025. Food\ncommodity prices remain significantly above the five-year\naverage, reducing household purchasing power.\nThe analysis in this report is based on information available as\nof October 31, 2025.",

              "Photo: Diakonie-Katastrophenhilfe & JECO\nHURRICANE MELISSA\nSitRep - GBV Subcluster Haiti\nOctober 31 - November 15, 2025\nSous Cluster VBG Haïti\nHighlights\nNearly 254,545 people are affected by Hurricane Melissa across seven departments of the country.\nMore than 16 thousand people have been displaced and housed in temporary shelters.\nA state of emergency has been declared for three months, from November 3, 2025, to February 3, 2026, in the Southern, Southeastern, Grand'Anse,\nNippes, Western, and Northwestern departments, in order to intensify the response and guarantee the safety of the affected populations.\nSituation Overview\nAs of November 3, Hurricane Melissa has caused heavy human losses (43 deaths, 21 injured, 13 missing) and material damage, including over 11,900 homes\nflooded and 4,433 destroyed or damaged in the South, Grand'Anse, South East, Nippes, West, Artibonite, and North West departments. The DGPC anticipates up\nto 2.3 million affected people. Approximately 16,000 people have been displaced and are taking refuge in shelters where urgent needs include food, drinking\nwater, hygiene kits, and health care. The increased exposure of women and girls to GBV risks in precarious shelters requires an immediate intensification of\nprotection prevention and response activities. The state of emergency decreed for three months aims to reinforce assistance to victims, secure the affected\nareas, and facilitate the return of essential services.\nResponse\nPartners have immediately and actively responded to the most urgent needs in the affected departments:\nSeveral partners—FVCB, DKH (RODEP and la Protection Civile, JECO, PROFAMIL, COOPI, UNFPA—conducted massive distributions\nof kits in the South, South East, Grand’Anse, and West departments:\n6,000 dignity kits for women and girls\n1,700 hygiene kits\n600 mama kits\nIntegrated mobile teams for Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH)—UNFPA, CDS, FOSREF,\nWorld Relief, Kay Fanmont—were deployed with partners to provide psychosocial support and care for survivors.\n4 mobile clinics in displacement sites served 241 people (174 women and 67 men).\nEmergency reproductive health kits pre-positioned by UNFPA:\n43 facilities, covering approximately 4,200 deliveries and 180 rape cases.\nNeeds and Challenges\n1. Widespread absence of dignity and hygiene kits adapted to the specific needs of GBV survivors, aggravating their vulnerability and exposure to stigma\nand the risk of infection in displacement sites and affected communities\n2. Insufficient emergency psychosocial support mechanisms for survivors, given the multiplication of traumas and the lack of safe, confidential spaces\nallowing for emotional support and psychological recovery following the disaster.\n3. Lack of dedicated funding limiting the implementation of cash transfers to meet essential needs and strengthen the autonomy of GBV survivors.\n4. A severe deficit in the secure referral of GBV cases and holistic care in surrounding hospitals: lack of information, liaison teams, specialized services, and\ndifficulties with access due to financial, logistical, or security reasons—compromising survivors' access to quality care, legal protection, and restorative justice.\n5. Furthermore, the persistence of the humanitarian funding gap (70%) prevents any adapted response, severely limiting the availability and quality of all\nnecessary services to protect, treat, and support survivors."

              "UNFPA REGIONAL SITUATION REPORT I HURRICANE MELISSA I 8 - 18 NOVEMBER 2025\nUNFPA Response\nUNFPA continues to actively contribute to inter-agency coordination efforts, supporting Humanitarian\nCoordinators and working closely with UN Country Teams to ensure that SRH and GBV priorities are fully\nintegrated into the collective response to Hurricane Melissa. UNFPA also contributes to joint analysis,\nplanning and decision-making processes across clusters and thematic working groups, helping ensure\ncoherence between national priorities, inter-agency strategies and field-level implementation.\nIn Haiti, three UNFPA funded mobile clinics delivered SRH and GBV services to 1,281 people displaced by\nthe hurricane, including 26 pregnant women and eight breastfeeding mothers. In Jamaica, UNFPA\nprovided integrated SRH and GBV services at a displacement shelter, reaching 55 women and adolescent\ngirls with vital healthcare and information.\nIn Haiti and Jamaica, UNFPA conducted awareness-raising sessions on GBV with 1,585 community\nmembers affected by Hurricane Melissa. These sessions aim to prevent GBV and ensure that survivors are\ninformed about available support services and how to access them. Following the sessions, UNFPA\ndistributed 971 dignity kits to women and adolescent girls, as well as 160 mama kits to new mothers,\nprioritizing those who were displaced and most in need.\nIn Cuba, assessments have been conducted in affected areas, and the distribution of 40 inter-agency\nreproductive health (IARH) kits, and contraceptives—which include 10,000 IUDs, and 4,200 subdermal\nimplants—is underway. Additionally, 650 dignity kits have been provided to health authorities for\ndistribution to women and girls.\nUNFPA and its implementing partners also continued to ensure that the women and girls have access to\npsychosocial support through the existing women and girls’ safe spaces and GBV services points. In Haiti\nand Jamaica, UNFPA provided counselling and psychosocial support to 442 women and girls affected by\nHurricane Melissa.\nRegional Results Snapshot",

              "TARGETING APPROACH\nCommunity Targeting Guidance – Hurricane Melissa Response\nStep 1: Awareness and Information Sharing\nLocal authorities and key stakeholders (mayors, CASEC/ASEC, school directors, health staff, religious\nleaders, etc.) are informed about the objectives, duration, targeting criteria, and type of assistance.\nCommunity awareness is also promoted through posters, meetings, and radio to ensure transparency and\nownership.\nStep 2: Formation of Community Targeting Committees\nCommittees of 5–7 trusted individuals (at least 50% women) are formed in each locality. Members are\nselected through participatory meetings and must not benefit from the assistance. Each committee signs an\nagreement outlining roles and responsibilities.\nStep 3: Committee Orientation\nCommittee members are trained on their roles, emphasizing transparency, impartiality, and voluntary\nparticipation. They are reminded that assistance is free and no compensation can be requested from\nbeneficiaries.\nStep 4: Establishing Targeting Criteria\nTwo categories of criteria are used:\nCategory 1: Households affected by Melissa (e.g., loss of income, damaged homes, displaced)\nCategory 2: Socioeconomic vulnerability (e.g., female-headed households, rural location, disability,\npoor housing) Eligibility requires meeting at least one shock-related criterion and three vulnerability\ncriteria, or being displaced in a shelter.\nStep 5: Household Listing and Validation\nCommittees compile household lists based on agreed criteria. WFP verifies a random sample (15%)—lists\nare validated if 80% meet the criteria. Final lists are signed by all involved during the community validation\nprocess.\nMETHODOLOGY APPROACH\nThis analysis is based primarily on real-time data collected between July and October 31, 2025. A total of\n350 household surveys were conducted from October 1 to 31, enabling the calculation of key indicators\nboth before and after the crisis, including the Food Consumption Score (FCS), Coping Strategies Index (CSI),\nand Household Hunger Scale (HHS).\nIn addition, a rapid multisectoral assessment (MSA) was carried out immediately following Hurricane\nMelissa. This assessment included focus group discussions across 18 prioritized communes, particularly in\nthe departments of Grand’Anse, Nippes, and Sud. The main objectives of the MSA were to:\nUnderstand the living conditions of affected households\nIdentify their most urgent needs\nDetermine the necessity for targeted support to the most vulnerable groups\nRecommend the most appropriate forms of assistance\nIt is important to note that the assessment did not include an agricultural component and therefore does\nnot evaluate the hurricane’s impact on the agricultural sector."

The highest rainfall totals—exceeding 300 percent of the historical average—were\nreported in Grand'Anse, Sud, Nippes, Sud-Est, Ouest, and L'Artibonite. Over a five-day period, rainfall surpassed\n400 mm. The accompanying gusty winds, flooding, and landslides damaged irrigation systems, which could pose a\nchallenge for farmers in the upcoming planting seasons.\nSince the beginning of November, rainfall has been sporadic and light. This has aided the drainage of flooded areas,\nreplenished water storage in reservoirs, and facilitated crop activity in areas where irrigation systems were not\nseverely affected. As shown in Figure 1, rainfall across most of Haiti for the period of November 11-20 did not exceed\n30 percent of the usual amounts, which supports recovery efforts and crop development. Additionally, observed high\ntemperatures are directly related to above-average evapotranspiration rates.\nThe rainfall forecast for next seven days (Figure 2) indicates average conditions for Haiti. This is favorable for\nagricultural activities and allows for the utilization of excess rainfall following Hurricane Melissa. Temperatures are\nexpected to be slightly above-average, providing some relief to communities engaged in rebuilding infrastructure and\nproduction systems.\nFigure 1 Figure 2\nPercent of rainfall November 11 – 20, 2025.

              "Haiti - Key Message Update November 2025\nHurricane Melissa and persistent insecurity worsen acute food insecurity\nKey Messages\nSeveral areas of the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Zone\n(ZMPP), including Cité Soleil, Croix-des-Bouquets, Port-au-Prince,\nand IDP sites, remain in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), while most\nrural areas of the country remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Poor\nhouseholds face a combination of crop losses, atypically high\nfood prices, and persistent insecurity, leading to increased\nreliance on negative coping strategies such as reducing the\nnumber of daily meals, selling productive assets, forced\nmigration, contracting risky debt, begging, and resorting to\ninformal or high-risk mechanisms, including survival sex. FEWS\nNET estimates that between 3.0 and 3.49 million people will\nrequire food assistance between November 2025 and May\n2026, with needs peaking during the lean season (April–May).\nInsecurity continues to deteriorate in the ZMPP, Artibonite,\nand Central Plateau. Armed group activity is paralyzing\nmobility, markets, and essential services, exacerbating internal\ndisplacement affecting more than 1.4 million people, including\n210,000 in the ZMPP. According to PLSO, no major area is\nconsidered safe. BINUH reports 1,247 deaths, 710 injuries, 145\nkidnappings, and more than 400 cases of sexual violence\nlinked to gang activity during Q3 2025. Since September,\napproximately 45,000 people have been displaced, some\nmultiple times (CCCM).\nThe impacts of Hurricane Melissa at the end of October,\nwith rainfall totals exceeding 250 mm, have significantly\nworsened food security conditions in several regions.\nAccording to the WFP, more than 1.25 million people were\naffected in the South, Southeast, Nippes, Grand’Anse, and West\ndepartments, with over 11,900 homes flooded or damaged and\nnearly 16,000 people sheltered in temporary facilities.\nAgricultural losses are substantial, including the destruction of\nautumn crops (banana, maize, sorghum, roots and tubers,\npigeon peas) in the hardest-hit communes, damage to irrigation\ninfrastructure, and road blockages limiting market access. These\nshocks have sharply reduced food availability and household\nagricultural income.\nFood prices remain atypically high nationwide, well above the five-year average, driven by the seasonal\nabsence of harvests and crop losses from Hurricane Melissa. In hurricane-affected areas, price increases are\nparticularly pronounced. For example, yellow maize in Jérémie rose 31 percent between September and\nOctober — further constraining poor households’ economic access to food.",

              "UNFPA Regional Situation Report I Hurricane Melissa I 19 - 30 November 2025\nRegional Situation Overview\nJamaica, Haiti and Cuba continue to face humanitarian and recovery challenges following Hurricane\nMelissa. Displacement, disrupted essential services, and heightened health risks—particularly for\nwomen, girls, and other vulnerable populations—remain pressing concerns.\nWidespread displacement persists across the affected countries, with many people unable to return\nhome and relying on temporary shelter arrangements or community support. Overcrowding, lack of\nprivacy, and insecure conditions is increasing the risk of GBV for those displaced.\nFloodwaters have contaminated water sources and created breeding grounds for mosquitoes,\nheightening public health issues. Authorities have declared outbreaks of arboviral diseases in Cuba and\nleptospirosis in Jamaica. The risk to pregnant women is particularly concerning due to the risk of severe\nfetal complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, and neonatal death. Haiti is also\nfacing an ongoing cholera crisis, worsened by displacement and affected water and sanitation facilities.\nUNFPA Response\nSexual and reproductive health: 46 inter-agency reproductive health (IARH) kits3 were delivered to\nhealth facilities in Cuba and Haiti to support deliveries, treatment of STIs, and the clinical management\nof rape, of 7,200 people over a 3 month period. In addition, 650 hygiene kits and 50 mama kits were\ndistributed to pregnant and postpartum women. In Cuba, 10,000 IUDs were provided to family planning\nservices, and in Haiti, four mobile clinics provided 2,212 people with free essential SRH services.\nGender-based violence: In Haiti and Jamaica, a total of 670 women and adolescent girls affected by\nHurricane Melissa received dignity kits. The kits contain essential hygiene supplies as well as vital GBV\ninformation, and serve as critical entry points to GBV services. In Jamaica, GBV awareness sessions and\npsychosocial support were provided to 579 people, and in Haiti, GBV mobile teams were deployed to\naffected areas, providing 502 women and adolescent girls with psychosocial support and information on\navailable GBV support services.\nRegional Results Snapshot",

              "Operational Context\nHaiti ranks 163 out of 191 countries on the 2021 Human\nDevelopment Index. The country continues to face one of the world’s\nhighest levels of chronic food insecurity, with over half of its\npopulation chronically food insecure and 22 percent of children\nchronically malnourished. This crisis is driven by a combination of\nextreme poverty, escalating violence, displacement, and recurrent\nnatural disasters. The latest IPC analysis shows that 5.7 million\npeople in Haiti, nearly half the population, are facing high levels of\nacute food insecurity, including around 1.9 million in Emergency (IPC\nPhase 4). Projections for March to June 2026 indicate this number\ncould rise to 5.9 million if current conditions persist. While recent\nimprovements in specific areas are noted, they remain fragile. A\ncombination of humanitarian assistance, partner interventions, local\ncoping strategies, and temporary access gains has lifted an\nestimated 8,400 displaced people in moving from Catastrophic (IPC\n5) to Emergency (IPC 4) and contributed to a reduction of roughly\n200,000 people in IPC 4 since April 2025. However, needs continue\nto exceed available resources, particularly as Haiti navigates the\nhurricane season without pre-posi tioned contingency stocks. Any\nmajor shock could rapidly worsen food insecurity. WFP’s priority\nremains to support the Government in advancing sustainable\nsolutions to hunger and achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2,\nZero Hunger.\nFood Imports: over 80 percent of\nrice is imported\nPopulation: 11 million\nGlobal acute malnutrition\n2021 Human Development Index: prevalance: 7,2% nationally\n163 out of 191 countries",

Poor households are increasingly\nresorting to negative coping strategies, including reducing the\nnumber of meals, borrowing, begging, selling productive assets,\nand internal migration. These strategies contribute to the\npersistence of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4)\noutcomes and are expected to become more widespread during\nthe lean season, from February to June.\nClashes between armed groups and security forces,\ninvolving targeted operations and the use of heavy weapons\nand explosives, continue to disrupt mobility, markets, and\naccess to essential services. Expanding territorial control by\ngangs limits trade flows, reduces economic activity, and restricts\naccess to livelihoods, while also fueling new internal\ndisplacement. According to the International Organization for\nMigration, armed violence on January 8 in several\nneighborhoods of Port-au-Prince displaced approximately 5,836\npeople, most of whom were hosted by families or settled in\nexisting sites, with concentrations in the communes of Port-au-\nPrince (42 percent), Delmas (29 percent), and Cité Soleil (28\npercent).\nThe winter agricultural season (pigeon peas, sorghum, beans,\nand maize) is unfolding amid persistent security constraints and\nworsening economic conditions. In several areas including Lower\nArtibonite, Lower Plateau, and the West (particularly Montrouis,\nArcahaie, and ZMPP), lack of regular access to farmland,\ninputs, and markets due to insecurity has reduced area planted for the winter season, limiting\nproduction potential. Harvests expected between March and May are likely to be below average, reducing\nagricultural incomes and household food availability, while prolonging dependence on markets between\nFebruary and May. At the same time, rising prices of agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizer, fuel), erosion of\nhousehold purchasing power, limited access to credit, reduced agricultural incomes — along with residual",
