Wetter-than-usual conditions were observed in\nRwanda, northern Uganda, southern South Sudan, western Kenya, and northern\nTanzania. However, the seasonal rainfall was erratic, with dry spells and intense\nrainfall, particularly in northeast Kenya, negatively affecting crops and rangeland.\nSince Dec, the region has been generally dry. Latest updates (1st week Feb)\nindicate rain deficit with some areas experiencing dry soil (Fig1) in southwestern\nUganda and western/southeastern Tanzania, making these areas more vulnerable\nto severe flooding if heavy rain occurs (see Drought-Flood Cycle below). No\nmajor flooding between Dec-Feb, as La Niña led to a drier conditions.\n• Temperature: OND is not a strong heat season for most of the countries in the\nregion. However, warmer than usual conditions were observed over the region\n(Copernicus) as predicted in the forecasts.\n• Food insecurity: Poor cropping and vegetation condition were found across most\nof Somalia, eastern Ethiopia, Northern Kenya and northern Sudan. Surface water\ndepletion was reported in northern Kenya and several points in ‘watch’ situation\nin South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia.\n• Health: There have been many protracted cholera outbreaks over recent months, ongoing from the region wide outbreaks of 2023/24, with\n>10K cases in South Sudan, >2K cases in Sudan and hundreds reported in Somalia and Uganda in January 2025 alone [WHO]. M-pox has\ncontinued to spread from DRC, Burundi and Uganda to South Sudan and there have been a small number of cases of Ebola (Sudan Virus) in\nUganda and Marburg recently in Tanzania. Dengue cases have been reported in Sudan [AfricaCDC] and measles in Ethiopia and Kenya.\n• Conflicts and displacement: During OND 2023, heavy rains and flooding displaced thousands across Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia,\nEthiopia and Tanzania [UN-IOM]. Over the 2024 OND season, hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Sudan conflict arrived in\nneighbouring countries, and internal displacement rose especially in South Sudan due to floods. In January, 24,885 people were displaced in\nNasir County and Abyei Administrative Area, with 56% women and girls. Most displacements (21,385) were in Nasir County due to food\ninsecurity and fires, while 3,500 people were displaced in Abyei AA by fires [IOM-DTM].\nTHE DROUGHTS - FLOOD CYCLE LAKE VICTORIA RAISING WATER\nThe capacity of a region to buffer the impacts of a flood depend Water levels in Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest freshwater lake, follow\non the soil, vegetation and the rivers/streams response capacity. seasonal patterns closely linked to rainfall, peaking in May/Jun and\nAfter droughts, soil becomes hard and hydrophobic, preventing dropping in Oct/Nov [NASA].

Despite this MAM season indicating below normal rainfall in the\nregion, the most prevalent diseases expected are mainly malaria, cholera and other waterborne diseases (Reliefweb). In SSD, floods are\nalso known to spread pollution from oil, war debris and dead animals across the region, affecting the health of communities, as well as\nthe livelihoods and nutritional status of pastoralist communities, as cattle sicken, and agriculture is made more difficult. Rec: Flood\nresponses, WASH, vaccination, Malaria prevention, collaborative with VSF for active cattle RVF surveillance.\nTemperatures. The GHA is expected to experience above-average temperatures during the MAM season especially in Sudan, Ethiopia,\nNorthern Somalia and parts of Tanzania (southeast) and Kenya (north). This will worsen already very hot conditions during this season in\nSouth Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, and northern Kenya, and bring some unexpected hotter days in countries where heat is usually less\nprominent during this season, such as Tanzania or Ethiopia. This is may reduce crop yields and increase heat stress among vulnerable\ncommunities (GHHIN) Rec.: ICPAC weekly heat forecasts, ensure supply cold-chain, monitor vulnerable groups.\nAir pollution, particle matter (PM) and Wildfires. Air PM levels are above the WHO safety limit (15µg/m³) across the region, except for\nsouthern Somalia and Tanzania. Pollution is usually lower during the MAM season, except in Sudan and South Sudan, where it rises from\nFeb-May and peaks in March. March marks the end of the wildfire season, except for Tanzania which is the middle of the low season (Dec-\nMay) and South Sudan, where the wildfire season extends to April/May. Rec: Monitor IQAIR (real-time) or Windy (5-day forecast).\nDrought and drier than normal conditions are expected over the MAM season on the eastern part of the GHA. These conditions can\ncontribute to famine, increased malnutrition cases, reduced water quality, and to dust storms and meningitis outbreaks. With some areas\nforecasted to see below average rains, risk may persist longer than usual (Jaca et al, AfricaCDC, WHO). Rec.: monitor ICPAC Drought Watch\nLa Niña is a phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) characterized by a cooling of the tropical Pacific ocean. It impacts vulnerable\ncommunities with extreme weather events such as increased droughts, floods and storms on other regions. This phase is however\nexpected to diminish by April, transitioning to neutral conditions afterwards (FAO). Rec.: monitor ENSO forecast.\nInfectious diseases: With the USAID freeze leaving many people living with HIV unable to access antiretrovirals, opportunistic infections\nmay increase over 2025. Mpox cases are reducing in Uganda with vaccinations ongoing [WHO] but cases have been reported in South\nSudan. Malaria cases have been above average in parts of South Sudan and are projected to rise further in 2025 in some states [WHO].\nAcross \"meningitis belt“ countries, the peak season is ending, however due to dryer than usual conditions in the eastern GHA region, risk\nmay remain above usual for MAM. Rec: WHO Meningitis weekly bulletin and Dashboard, and the meningitis/dust alerts by ACMAD.\nFood insecurity: Food insecurity and malnutrition are expected to remain critical across the GHA, driven by conflict, economic pressure\nand climate shocks, especially in Sudan and South Sudan. Ongoing conflict in Sudan and the worsening crisis in South Sudan, including\nincreased flooding, will worsen food security. Below-average rainfall during MAM season will worsen food insecurity in Somalia, eastern\nKenya, and parts of Ethiopia. Uganda's refugee-hosting districts are also facing growing food insecurity, particularly in the west. Agriculture\nin Northeastern Kenya is at risk due to high temperatures and low rainfall. As FEWSNET is down, please check IPC for forecasts.\nPests: Locust are expected to decline in the Red Sea but increase in northern Sudan and Southern Egypt, where breeding will start soon.\nIn Somalia, no significant developments are likely. Rec: monitor FAO monthly locust bulletins.\nThe Humanitarian Action for Climate and Environment is an MSF-Canada choice initiative Contact us:\nestablished in 2020to support Climate Change Adaptation within the movement.

Red bars represent local (statewide) weeks per month (1, 2 or 3+\n10 45 70 weeks/ month) with temperatures >35°C (health impacts) [CKP], this is the average from 1994-2014. We chose states with nearby MSF projects at high risk of heat-\n1 2 3+ related morbidity (WG=Woqooyi Galbeed, Somalia. Kh=Khartoum, Sudan. Un=Union, S. Sudan. Af=Afar, Ethiopia). N.b. Many countries have highly variable local rainfall\nand heat index patterns, for more precise heat and humidity related historical data we would recommend reviewing [ERA5].\nThe mosquito symbol represents historical monthly malaria peaks [data from PMI, Noor et al, MSF and Elagali et al]. N.b. Malaria is endemic and outbreaks can occur\noutside of these periods, especially following atypical rainfall and temperature patterns impacting vectors, and migration affecting community immunity.\nThe tap with contaminated water symbol to the left signifies periods when cholera outbreak risk is historically highest [data from Perez-Saez et al]. This could\npotentially (with caution!) also be used as a proxy for the risk of other waterborne diseases, but many other environmental and social factors alter outbreak risk.\nThe meningitis symbol represents months where historical meningitis outbreak risk is high [from EMDAT and peer-reviewed literature]. This peaks in the dry season\nacross the meningitis belt as ‘Harmattan winds’ bring Saharan dust, which damages the mucosal barrier and inhibits immune defences, facilitating bacterial invasion –\nbut outbreaks can occur year-round. Check ACMAD for meningitis/dust storm warnings and forecasts but these are infrequently updated [methods here - Dione et al].\nHot days\nClimate: During the Deyr season, most regions in Somalia experienced uneven rainfall distribution with areas such as Baki recording above-average\nseasonal rainfall while other regions like Jubaland, Galmadug, Hishabelle experiencing below normal rainfall. Higher temperatures are common between\nMay-Sep, with more hot days (>35°C). Humid heat (temperature and humidity combined) is highest in April. Following the hot and dry Jilal season, the\nupcoming Gu season is forecasted to be drier and hotter than usual, undermining agriculture, water availability, displacement, food insecurity and\na\nila additional health crises (SWALIM). Health: Given the anticipated reduced rainfall for MAM, malnutrition is expected to increase especially in children,\nm water-borne diseases may rise due to unavailability of WASH, alongside heat-related illnesses (SWALIM). Nutrition: Malnutrition is likely to increase with\no the La Niña-induced drought conditions, high food prices, limited stocks, high shipping costs and ongoing conflict and insecurity in central, parts of\nnorthwest and southern Somalia (IPC). Pests: Minimal locust activity observed, and very low numbers of solitary adults may persist along the northwest\ncoast and there is a low chance of forecasted swams/outbreaks for March-May. No significant developments expected [FAO].\nHot days\n(SUD south)\nClimate: With December to February being a hot and dry season, the upcoming March to May period usually sees\nthese conditions persist. The forecast MAM is for zero to minimal rainfall, whilst temperatures are highly likely to be\nabove average, with high heat stress and heatwaves likely, especially in the north. Flooding in Rabak, White Nile\ndisplaced >8000 people in Dec/Jan [DTM] Health: With the ongoing war, a growing population in IDP camps has\nstrained limited resources on WASH practices contributing to a new wave of cholera outbreaks which may persist over\nthe oncoming season, made worse by water scarcity. Dengue and malaria cases have been reported in some areas.\nHeat related illnesses such as heat stroke are also expected to increase, being a dry season for the country (UNHCR).\nn\na Nutrition: It is estimated that 90% of displaced households are unable to afford food now in Sudan [UN]. With the\nd\nu USAID freeze and food insecurity worsening, 80% of local food kitchens have been forced to close and famine is likely\nS to spread. In besieged areas of Al Fasher and North Darfur, the possibility of IPC phase 5 is high and will likely persist\nin Zamzam and IDP camps, creating high chances of escalating starvation, acute malnutrition and mortality and\ndisplacement (FEWSNET). This dry and hot period is exacerbating malnutrition (FEWSNET). Pests: There were some\nlarge locust swarms in Sudan in Jan 2025 [FAO]. A new generation of breeding will continue along the Red Sea coast\npreparing for the breeding in the following months.\noutbreak risk\nHot days\nClimate: Recent heatwaves have led to school closures for the second year running as children are especially\nvulnerable to the impacts of heat on their health [EN]. Whilst staying at home can help them stay cool, this has\nnegative impacts on their education, development and general wellbeing. Across December to February, the country\nexperienced a very hot and dry period, which is likely to be followed mostly by above average rainfall over March to\nMay, especially in the East. In 2024, seasonal flooding displaced hundreds of thousands of people and livestock and\ndestroyed crops (IRC). Water levels have not receded as much as usual, and are unseasonally high for early March in\nn\na many places. This increases the risk of more significant flooding in areas forecasted for heavy MAM rainfall (ICPAC,\nd\nu FEWSNET). Health: Cholera cases are still ongoing since the outbreak in late 2024, although in most areas cases are\nh\nreducing. An m-pox outbreak was declared in Juba in February this year, and the Ministry of Health alongside WHO\nt addressing it (WHO). With the expected above normal rainfall over the eastern parts of the country, we anticipate\nu\no increased cases of cholera, malaria and measles, including extreme heat related cases (WHO, Humanitarian Action).\nThe meningitis dry season is coming to an end. Nutrition: High levels of food insecurity over the past few months may\nincrease acute malnutrition by 26% compared to 2024, primarily among children and pregnant and lactation women\n(Humanitarian Action). Floods spread pollution from oil, war debris, and dead animals, contaminating water and\nharming both human and cattle health. This affects livelihoods, particularly for pastoralist communities, and their cholera outbreak risk\nnutrition[Rift Valley Institute]. Pests: No significant locust activity forecasted for Mar-May [FAO].\nClimate: Following the hot season of December to February, we expect MAM to have above normal rainfall over the eastern half of the country, with below\na d normal rainfall across the western half of the country. This may likely cause localized flooding on certain areas, with potential mudslides (ICPAC). Health:\nn As of February, Ebola virus was declared an outbreak in the country and rising (CDC). Other expected diseases during the oncoming MAM season include\na\ng malaria, and waterborne diseases due to poor WASH (AMREF). Nutrition: With the recently witnessed poor rainfall performance, prolonged dry spells,\nU\nconflicts and diseases, a large number of children and breastfeeding women will likely face acute malnutrition, increasing from IPC phase 3 and above\nacross the forecasted period (IPC). Pests: No significant locust activity is forecasted for March-May [FAO].\nThe Humanitarian Action for Climate and Environment is an MSF-Canada choice initiative Contact us:\nestablished in 2020to support Climate Change Adaptation within the movement.

The Gu/Genna\nrains in eastern Ethiopia are likely to be below average. The western parts bordering South Sudan may experience\nwetter conditions, favouring agriculture and pastoralism. This may however be impacted by high temperatures which\nwill increase evaporation rates and bring about heat stress (ICPAC). Most areas will have less than a week of\ntemperatures above 35°C annually, except in the northwest and Afar, where temperatures will rise in MAM and exceed\n35°C for over two weeks each month from April to October. Health: The ongoing conflict in the Amhara and Oromia\na regions is severely affecting public health, with increased violence and barriers to accessing health services,\nip complicating the response to outbreaks like cholera, measles, and malaria. With at least 10 earthquakes recently\no\nih reported in Ethiopia and signs of possible volcanic activity evacuations have begun for approximately 80K people in\nt E Afar, Oromia and Amhara. Access restrictions imposed by local militia prevent population’s access to health and relief\nservices. Flooding will likely affect areas such as Gambella, damaging healthcare facilities, affecting WASH\ninfrastructure, increasing malaria cases and also affect crop and animal rearing in areas with poor rainfall patterns\n(ICPAC). Nutrition: In areas where there will be improved water supply - in the western parts of the country during\nMarch-May, livestock health may improve which will further enhance nutrition and income generation for pastoralists.\nHowever, in the central and east part of the country, crop failures, water and pasture shortages may lead to a decline in\nFFiigg 66.. EEtthhiiooppiiaa hhiissttoorriiccaall cchhoolleerraa\nlivestock productivity, reducing dairy production and limited nutritional intake, affecting children and pregnant women oouuttbbrreeaakk RRiisskk\n(ICPAC). Low crop production, high food prices, and lack of social pregnant women (ICPAC). Low crop production, high\nfood prices, and lack of humanitarian and social protection support, have increased acute food insecurity recently. As we come out of the lean season in\nSomali region in April the lean season in Oromia will last until late May after the Belg rains finish Pests: No significant locust activity is forecasted for\nMarch-May [FAO].\nHot days\n(KEN North)\nClimate: Following the below-average rainfall in most parts of the country on the previous season, MAM forecast indicates a higher likelihood of above\naverage rainfall over western and southern parts of Kenya, exceeding 200mm across the season, with below average rainfall across central and coastal\nparts (ICPAC). The northern and eastern parts of the country are expected to have below average rainfall (KMD). In northern Kenya, peak temperatures\na and hot days occur from January to May, with humid heat highest from March to April. Heat stress is expected to increase due to above-average\ny n temperatures forecasted for MAM. Southeastern and coastal Kenya will experience lower temperatures and fewer hot days, with conditions forecasted to\ne remain normal. Health: With expected floods and stagnating water over localized areas during the MAM season, we expect waterborne and vector borne\nK\ndiseases to increase slightly mainly due to poor water and sanitation facilities. Heat stress on the other hand may be prominent in below average areas of\nnorthern and eastern parts, with increased respiratory infections (KMD). Nutrition: Even though the country has made progress in reducing malnutrition, it\nremains a concern in arid and semi-arid counties common with recurrent drought, less rainfall and limited access to healthcare, mostly affecting children\nunder 5, pregnant and lactating women (KMD, MOH). Pests: Whereas MAM rainfall may provide benefits for some regions, certain areas affected by\nreduced/increased rainfall and moisture content will encourage internal and external parasites and Transboundary Animal Diseases amidst conflict for\npasture and water among human, wildlife and livestock (ICPAC). No significant locust activity is forecasted for March-May [FAO].\nClimate: Tanzania experienced above average rainfall across December to January, with ranges from 200 – 500mm being observed in the central and\nsouthern parts, which is favourable for agriculture. This upcoming MAM season will be characterized with moderate to above rainfall across most parts of\nthe country, except for areas around the northwest which will likely experience normal to below average conditions. Chances of flooding and flash floods\nare high (ICPAC). Health: Cases of the Marburg Virus Disease have been reported since January 2025, with a high fatality rate across the Kagera region\na in (WHO). Other anticipated diseases during this rainy season include vector-borne such as yellow fever, dengue, Zika, all of which are transmitted by\na mosquitoes. Neglected tropical diseases such as schistosomiasis are also prevalent and expected in certain regions (Smart Traveller). Nutrition: Despite\nz\nn progress in nutrition cases, 34% of children under 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition and 58% from anaemia, affecting both rural and urban areas\na\nT (USAID). Whereas agriculture is expected to thrive in the country during this season, malnutrition cases are still expected. Pests: For areas forecasted to\nexperience dry conditions, fall army worm is expected to increase, whereas wetter conditions are likely to encourage the emergence of plants and\ndiseases such as fungal diseases. All these have dire effects mostly in rural areas with limited infrastructure and increased soil erosion. No significant\nlocust activity is forecasted for March-May [FAO].\nClimate: OND rainfall patterns in Rwanda were characterized by a delayed onset with moderate rainfall experienced over most parts of the country,\naffecting agriculture. This year’s MAM season is expected to have below normal rainfall across most parts of the country, with exceptions of above normal\na rainfall over few hilly and mountainous areas. Chances of landslides are quite high in hilly areas over this season, affecting further agriculture and\nd\nn subsequently food insecurity (ICPAC, ReliefWeb). Health: During rainy seasons, the country experiences a hike in malaria cases compared to dry seasons\na\nw (Rubuga et al). However, geographical disparities and poor infrastructure reduces the interventions of health services across affected areas, hindering\nR quality healthcare in vector-borne diseases (USAID). Nutrition: NCDs remain a huge challenge in the country, affecting specifically children on malnutrition\nand stunted growth increasing neonatal mortality. Increased cases of rift valley fever during rainy seasons have an impact on mental health issues through\nits effects on nutrition (USAID, ICPAC). Pests: Fall armyworms are expected over this season, damaging crops especially maize, causing significant yield\nloss (REMA).\nDISCLAIMER: Whileclimate forecasts can offer insights on health outcomes, many other drivers (e.g. conflict, displacement, migration, socio-economics, politics, immunity\nand vaccination) modulate disease transmission and should be considered possible. Furthermore, the impact of weather conditions may peak well after shifts in weather.\nThe Humanitarian Action for Climate and Environment is an MSF-Canada choice initiative Contact us:\nestablished in 2020to support Climate Change Adaptation within the movement.

As of 26 November 2025, 78 laboratory\ntests have been conducted, of which twelve confirmed cases, including seven confirmed deaths, have been reported, three cases remain\nprobable. Of the twelve confirmed cases, five are currently alive, three on treatment, and two discharged. More than 300 contacts have\nbeen identified and are under active follow-up. Given the high fatality potential and rapid transmissibility of Marburg, (MVD) an\nimmediate and coordinated public health response is essential. Early detection, isolation, contact tracing, and community sensitization\nare critical to prevent further spread by strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) in health facilities, ensuring the safety of\nhealth workers, mobilizing rapid response teams (RRTs), and effective risk communication are key priorities at this stage.\nAn urgent response is warranted due to the potential for rapid local and cross-regional transmission, and significant public health threat\nassociated with hemorrhagic fevers. Delayed intervention could result in high morbidity and mortality, community panic and\noverburdening of the health system. Immediate action will help contain the outbreak source, interrupt transmission chains, and protect\nboth the affected population and health workers while laboratory confirmation and epidemiological investigations continue.\nPage 2 / 23\n\nERCS RCCE training by RHB and WHO\nScope and Scale\nExtent of Potential Negative Impacts:\nEthiopia has recently confirmed its first-ever Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak reported in Jinka town of the South Ethiopia Region.\nAs of November 14th, 2025, a total of six cases have been reported. Genetic analysis by the Ethiopia Public Health Institute revealed that\nthe virus is of the same strain as the ones that has been reported in previous outbreaks in other countries in East Africa.\nThe Marburg disease is a severe and often fatal illness caused by the Marburg virus. The disease is often characterized by high fever,\nsevere headache, muscle aches and fatigue. Many patients develop severe bleeding within a week of onset. The disease is rapidly\ntransmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals or contaminated materials.\nThe disease can lead to significant disruption to local health systems. A potential outbreak could lead to increased morbidity and\nmortality, fear and stigma within communities, and interruption of essential services due to movement restrictions or fear of healthcare\nsettings.\nLivelihoods— particularly those dependent on daily trade, livestock markets, and cross-border movement—could be severely disrupted.\nInfrastructure such as health facilities may become overwhelmed or constrained by infection control requirements and staff shortages.\nMost at risk Populations:\nThe populations most likely to experience impacts include those residing in Jinka Town and surrounding rural kebeles within the South\nOmo Zone. This area has limited health infrastructure, low access to sanitation and clean water, and frequent population movement for\ntrade and pastoral activities—all of which increase exposure and complicate containment efforts.\nVulnerable groups include:\n1. Children and the elderly, who have weaker immune systems and limited resilience to infection and dehydration.\n2. Pregnant and lactating women, due to heightened physiological vulnerability and barriers to care-seeking.\n3. People with disabilities who often face mobility and communication challenges during health emergencies.\n4. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees in and around the South Omo area, who live in crowded conditions with poor access\nto health services.\n5. Health workers who are at elevated risk due to direct exposure and inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.\nGeographic and Social Vulnerability:\nSouth Omo Zone is geographically remote with poor road networks and limited laboratory capacity, delaying diagnosis and response.\nThe population’s mobility across regional and cross-border routes (e.g., with Kenya and South Sudan) also increases the risk of wider\nPage 3 / 23\n\nspread. Cultural practices such as close family care for the sick and traditional burial rituals may further heighten transmission risks if not\nmanaged with community engagement and safe practices.\nHistorical Context:\nEthiopia and neighboring countries have previously experienced outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers such as Rift Valley Fever and Yellow\nFever, which caused significant loss of life, livestock, and economic disruption. For instance, past outbreaks in Southern and\nSouthwestern Ethiopia have resulted in livestock deaths, human infections, and trade restrictions. These historical experiences highlight\nthe region’s high susceptibility to zoonotic and epidemic-prone diseases, emphasizing the urgency of rapid containment, community\nawareness, and cross-sectoral coordination.\nIn summary, the confirmed Marburg cases in Jinka represent a serious emerging health hazard with the potential to cause widespread\nsocial, health, and economic consequences if not rapidly contained through a well-coordinated public health emergency response.\nSource Name Source Link\n1.

Following recent reports from the Ministry of Health (MoH)\nand the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) on suspected hemorrhagic fever cases in\nJinka Town, the IFRC has confirmed its readiness to support ERCS in mounting a timely\nand coordinated response.\nSupport and Coordination:\nThe IFRC Country Delegation has initiated discussions with ERCS and MoH to assess the\nsituation, align with national coordination mechanisms, and explore early activation of\nemergency tools, including a potential Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF)\nrequest.\nTechnical and Strategic Support:\nIFRC is providing technical guidance in key areas including:\n- Public Health in Emergencies (PHE) and epidemic preparedness\n- Community-based surveillance and RCCE\n- Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) and health promotion\n- Operational planning, coordination, and rapid response mechanisms\n- PMER: Systematic tracking, reporting, and learning\n- Finance & Administration: Timely mobilization and accountable management of DREF\nor other funds\n- Human Resources: Deployment of technical and surge staff\n- Security: Context analysis, safety guidance, and coordination with UNDSS\n- Logistics: International Procurement, supply chain support, and transport of health\nand WASH supplies\n- National Society Development (NSD): Assessing ERCS’s institutional and technical\nPage 5 / 23\n\ncapacities in epidemic preparedness and emergency operations\nSummary: IFRC remains actively engaged and ready to support ERCS through technical\nassistance, coordination with national authorities, and resource mobilization, ensuring a\ntimely, effective, and accountable response to the emerging hemorrhagic fever threat in\nEthiopia with the support from the neighboring countries.\nParticipating National Societies Participating National Societies (PNSs) maintain ongoing partnerships and support\nprograms with the Ethiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS) in various sectors, including\nhealth, disaster management, and resilience building. These include the Danish Red\nCross, Finnish Red Cross, Norwegian Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross, and Netherlands Red\nCross, among others. Their current engagements primarily focus on longer-term health\nsystem strengthening, disaster risk reduction, and community resilience initiatives across\ndifferent regions of the country. The capacity built to the NS is mapped to support this\noperation with additional skill to manage MVD.\nFor this specific emergence, the Norwegian RC in country have committed to replenish\nthe stock and actively coordinating with their HQ for additional support. Netherland RC\nas a lead in ECHO DP, has communicated to the ECHO the NS action including the DREF\napplication, and the ECHO is following up with IFRC on the progress for possible\nsupport. From their ongoing projects, they have committed 10,000 USD to facilitate\nimmediate needs of the NS.\nThe ERCS, in coordination with the IFRC Country cluster Delegation, is closely monitoring\nthe situation and will organize the emergence meeting on 17th Nov to updates with\nstatus and to all PNS partners to facilitate timely coordination and mobilization of\nsupport as needed including the technical personnel. Meanwhile this DREF will be\ncommunicated to all PNS and ICRC. Once the situation is further assessed and response\nneeds are clarified, PNS contributions may be mobilized in alignment with the national\nresponse framework and the IFRC’s coordinated support, including possible engagement\nthrough the DREF mechanism or other joint response arrangements.\nICRC Actions Related To The Current Event\nICRC has presence in the country supporting on conflict related matters. The NS has shared the information with them, in the\nmeantime no support has been provided. NS will request the capacity strengthening in SDB and supplies from the prepositioned\nstocks.\nOther Actors Actions Related To The Current Event\nGovernment has requested international Yes\nassistance\nNational authorities The Ministry, in collaboration with EPHI, is undertaking coordinated surveillance and\nresponse activities to identify the source of infection, contain potential spread, and\nensure early detection of additional cases. Health authorities have deployed a rapid\nresponse team to the area to determine the cause, conduct laboratory testing, and\nprevent further spread.\nCommunity-level monitoring has been strengthened through engagement of local health\nworkers and volunteers, while contact tracing teams are actively identifying and\nfollowing up all individuals who may have been exposed to suspected cases. In addition,\nhouse-to-house case finding has been intensified to promptly detect any new symptoms\nwithin the community, facilitate timely referral to health facilities, and enhance public\nawareness on preventive and precautionary measures. Sample collection, packaging,\nand transportation for diagnosis and confirmation of the suspected cases started.\nPage 6 / 23\n\nUN or other actors WHO pledged to support 300, 000 USD for the response in the area and Africa CDC called\na meeting for coordination and collaboration for response. WHO Afro, UNICEF and\nACDC have deployed technical team to support the region in response. WHO is co-\nchairing with the MOH the coordination at national and regional level. Other\ninternational organization are mobilized to support the response.\nAre there major coordination mechanism in place?\nThe Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), under the Ministry of Health (MoH), leads preparedness and response coordination\nthrough the existing Incident Management System (IMS) at regional levels. Technical working groups and Emergency Operation Centers\n(EOCs) will be activated to oversee surveillance, case investigation, laboratory testing, and risk communication in response to the\nsuspected hemorrhagic fever in Jinka Town, South Ethiopia.\nNational coordination is guided by the Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC) chaired by EPHI, with participation from\nMoH, WHO, UNICEF, and key partners. At the regional level, the Regional Health Bureau (RHB) leads coordination through PHEM units\nin collaboration with local authorities and community health workers.\nRole of ERCS:\nThe Ethiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS) participates in coordination platforms at regional levels, supporting community engagement,\nrisk communication, contact tracing, and surveillance through its volunteer network. While not in a lead role, ERCS is a vital\noperational partner in community-based response activities.\nGaps/Overlaps:\nCurrent coordination is mainly health-focused, with limited involvement of non-health sectors such as logistics, psychosocial support,\nand WASH. Strengthening cross-sector coordination and information sharing between national and regional levels will enhance the\neffectiveness and inclusiveness of the response.\nNeeds (Gaps) Identified\nHealth\nThis is the first outbreak of Marburg in the country. The mortality rate of this disease, combined with the lack of awareness of the\ndisease, poses a significant risk to the country and its surroundings. Currently, the outbreak has strained local health systems in the\nregion, disrupted essential services, and has triggered widespread fear and misinformation across affected communities. In response, the\nEthiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS) Arsi Zonal Branch has mobilized volunteers and ambulance services in collaboration with government\ntaskforces, while Jinka General Hospital and ERCS Arsi Zone have urgently requested personal protective equipment (PPE) and other\ncritical supplies. Immediate actions expected from ERCS include intensified contact tracing, provision of PPE and infection control\nmaterials, safe patient transport, MHPSS and deployment of targeted risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) strategies\nto contain the outbreak. Meanwhile the NS capacity and knowledge on the Marburg remain limited and requires urgent support, thus\nthis operation will aim to strengthen the community-based health services and support the facilities to ensure MVD is contained in the\nshortest time, not limited to Arsi, but also in neighboring regions where the contact will be communicated.\nWater, Sanitation And Hygiene\nJinka Town and surrounding rural kebeles within the South Omo Zone has limited access to sanitation and clean water, and frequent\npopulation movement for trade and pastoral activities all of which increase exposure and complicate containment efforts. this response\noperation will strengthen WASH services along with awareness creation to ensure community adopt best practices.\nProtection, Gender And Inclusion\nCurrently the response has been meagering in case management and prevention, through this DREF ERCs will address protection gender\nand inclusion challenges to ensure specific needs of the special groups are addressed. Symptoms exhibited by the disease are bound to\nPage 7 / 23\n\nbring stigma and discrimination amongst affected community members, which requires parallel action. The right to information will be\nreinforced for different groups to ensure no one is left behind.\nCommunity Engagement And Accountability\nMisinformation and lack of knowledge on the part of communities is a significant risk that needs to be addressed from the outset\nthrough a strong feedback management system and engagement at both community and institutional levels through local leaders,\nstakeholders, and other actors.\nData collection and management will be an important pillar in addressing awareness raising. Existing feedback systems and other\nidentified will be activated to ensure information are well managed and timely collected and addressed.\nJointly with the RHB, will translate key messages and communicate to the community through different media to ensure wider coverage,\nand call for action for individual and institutions.\nAny identified gaps/limitations in the assessment\n- Insufficient WASH supplies for activation preventive measure.\n- Limited knowledge among the community on the outbreak, which led to normal treatment of cases.\n- In adequate PPE to meet standard of the MVD, only normal surgical PPE available and capacity is strained at regional level.\n- Reports from Government mentioned the strained capacity and limited medical supplies available.\n- Limited facilities to manage both normal and isolation for case management.\n- Limited health supplies to manage both isolation and general health facilities.\n- HCW, Volunteers deployed with limited PPE, urgent supply is required to meet the needs.\nAssessment Report\nOperational Strategy\nOverall objective of the operation\nThe IFRC-DREF operation aims to support the ERCS and the Ethiopian Ministry of Health and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute in\npreventing and controlling the Marburg outbreak in Ethiopia by enhancing early detection, case management, and community\nengagement, thereby minimizing morbidity, mortality, and the risk of further transmission.\nOperation strategy rationale\nThis plan is established based on standard response for hemorrhagic disease and proposed support, and operation teams follow the\ncapacity of the local branch and national Incident Management System. The operation will be implemented in close collaboration with\nMoH, EPHI, and the Regional Health Bureau, aligning with the existing government guidelines and SoP. The Ethiopian Red Cross Society\n(ERCS) will leverage its auxiliary role to strengthen community-level surveillance, risk communication, and volunteer mobilization,\nensuring coordinated and efficient outbreak control. Detailed below are the actions to be undertaken by ERCS for each pilar of\nintervention\nCoordination\nNS is already participating in coordination meetings at national and regional levels, to ensure alignment between its strategy and that of\nMoH for best impact ERCS will scale up participation in different pillars. This will be led by the DPR Director, Ns PH specialist, NS RCCE\nlead, NS MPHH coordinator, Southern region branch head, Branch program coordinator, WASH coordinator and others as may be\ndeemed. The structure is set to ensure NS is integrated in operational coordination and high-level discussion in county and at branch\nlevel.\nIFRC have activated a response support coordination cell which had its first routine 3.00 pm meeting on 14th Nov, with Geneva, region\nand cluster teams and will incorporate ERCS and other stakeholders in the federation. The in-country movement coordination will be\nactivated for a unified response approach. At country delegation level, IFRC operations is activated by the coordinator programs and\noperations, with the close follow up of the DRM Delegate with the support from the health technical team from region, CCD sr. PMER,\nPage 8 / 23\n\nlogistics, security, and finance to support the positioning of NS in the coordination system. A field coordinator, MVD Expert- PHiE surge\nwill be deployed to support the response at the field level reporting to the IFRC operations manager.\n1. Health\nAcross the health interventions, strong capacity through NS technical team, Surges will strenghten the capacity on the field. To reinforce\nhealth system or institutional readiness dfor effective health prevention, the operation will provide targeted training, essential WASH\nsupplies, and support for triage and isolation systems at health facilities. Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) will be strengthened to improve\ncase investigation, safe and dignified burials, contact tracing, and timely reporting. Community epidemic preparedness will be enhanced\nthrough the mobilization and training of 200 volunteers and Red Cross branches on CBS and EPiC. The duly trained volunteers and\ncommunity health workers will play a central role in early detection, rumor management, and dissemination of accurate health messages\nto build trust and counter misinformation. The health response will be anchored in a community-centered approach, prioritizing the\nfollowing pillars.\n- Health prevention\n- Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE).\n- Community-based surveillance (CBS)\n- Safe and dignified burials (SBD)\n- Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS)\n1.1. RCCE and health prevention\nOn the RCCE approach, clear, well-translated case definitions will be shared through multiple media channels to ensure communities\nadopt proper preventive measures. Messages will be co-developped with relevant stakeholders, and ERCS will support translation, and\ndissemination via radio, community dialogues, printed materials, and house-to-house sensitization. Community leaders, religious figures,\nand associations will be engaged to promote trust and adherence to public health measures. Through community feedback systems,\nrumor tracking will be integrated to counter misinformation and stigma, while border health surveillance will be reinforced using tools\nfrom the PREPARE project.\n1.2. CBS\nThe CBS strategy focuses on strengthening early detection and community-level response by training 200 volunteers and health workers\nthrough EPIC and CBS sessions that integrate CBHFA, ECV, PFA, PGI, and CEA modules. Once trained, volunteers will support case\ndetection, referral pathways, IPC practices, and proper use of personal protective equipment. They will work alongside community health\nworkers and surveillance teams to conduct active case finding and contact tracing, ensuring rapid identification of suspected cases. The\napproach also reinforces data collection and information flow between community structures, health posts, and district health offices to\nenable timely monitoring and response. To maintain effective communication and coordination at community level, airtime support will\nbe provided for volunteers and key local stakeholders, including community leaders.\nThe trained 200 Volunteers will enable early detection and reporting of suspected cases. Active case finding, contact tracing, and\ncommunity alert mechanisms will be linked to health facilities and the Public Health Emergency Management system, supported by\nairtime and coordination tools.\n1.2 SDB\nSafe and dignified burials will be addressed through surge support from neighboring countries, with ERCS staff, volunteers, and health\nworkers trained and equipped to conduct safe practices.\n1.3. Healkth servises (MHPSS and ambulances)\nERCS is providing ambulance services in the Southern region, However, the branch report revealed there is one ambulance in Jinka which\ncurrently has neither deployed health professional, nor trained volunteers for handling such outbreaks. it supports transportation\nservices only. Thus, through this intervention the ambulance attendants will be trained in IPC and support the ambulance operational\ncost for 4 months, for the worst case, more ambulances will be deployed from other zones to support the operation. The Surge\nambulance protection expert will be deployed to train the NS and ensure the duty of care to staff, volunteers and community.\nPsychosocial support will be integrated into the response, with volunteers trained in psychosocial first aid (PFA) to provide immediate\nsupport, referrals, and information on stress, grief, and coping. Dedicated psychosocial support will also be provided to staff and\nvolunteers to maintain resilience during the response.\n2. WASH\nWASH intervention at this stage prioritise the support to health facility readiness assessments to identify gaps in IPC materials, triage\nPage 9 / 23\n\nsystems, and isolation capacity in surrounding health facilities, as well as procuring and providing essential IPC supplies such as PPE,\ndisinfectants, thermos scanners, hand hygiene materials, environmental cleaning products, sprayers, soap, and chlorine for health\nworkers, health facilities, and volunteers responding to Marburg. ERCS will also provide logistical support for transporting IPC and WASH\ncommodities, volunteers, and response teams to affected kebeles. Volunteers will be oriented in basic IPC and WASH components for\ncommunity and personal safety, with WASH and hygiene promotion modules integrated into EPIC trainings. Hygiene promotion, WASH in\nhealth centers, and community-level activities will be incorporated into RCCE interventions, enabling the team to support disinfection in\nareas where suspected cases have been identified. ERCS will facilitate the installation of handwashing units at health centers, schools,\nmarkets, and border points, and deploy volunteers to manage these stations in public spaces and points of entry. Handwashing facilities\nwill also be procured and distributed for public use, particularly in epicenters and ERCS branches. Households with suspected cases or\nidentified through contact tracing will be equipped with handwashing buckets and soap to maintain continuous hygiene practices.\nAdditionally, ERCS will ensure safe water supply for drinking and hygiene and provide orientations for volunteers supporting WASH\nactivities, including waste management.\n3. Protection, gender and inclusion\nUnder PSEA, Prevention, Mitigation and Response to Gender-Based Violence (GBV), the priority will be to ensure streamlined information\nto the communities on referral pathway, prevention and sensitive feedbacks. Therefore, ERCS will first give briefings/orientations to\nVolunteers & staff on the ERCS safeguarding policies (PSEA). Under protection, ERCS will also train staff and volunteers on personal safety\n(Stay Safe) and the code of conduct.\nThe trained team will do the dissemination of the ERCS child protection and safeguarding policy, and ensure all staff and volunteers sign\nthe code of conduct. The stakeholders that will work with the NS will also get the relevant Safeguarding briefings and be required to work\nunder the relevant requirements for PSEA and safeguarding.\nThe trained team with the lead of the PGI focal point of the NS will conduct a rapid gender analysis in the affected areas, ensuring to map\nout and update existing referral pathways for survivors of SGBV/VAC. Integrated to the CEA strategies, the community reporting and\nfeedback mechanisms for SEA related incidents will be widely disseminated to the communities during awareness campaign and using IEC\nprintings planned under this DREF for the families and response team references on key safeguarding messages, the hotlines and way to\nreport any incidents. In case of breach to the standards, ERCS as per its policy will conduct investigations into allegations of SEA within\nthe response.\nThe ERCS will ensure inclusive and responsible operation that is sensitive to marginalised groups and specific context setting. as part of\nthe piorities, the NS will develop and disseminate inclusive/accessible IEC materials on MVD for people with hearing or visual\nimpairments. Thevolunteers engaged will be representative in age and sex to ensure more integration and acceptance when deployed.\nThey will conduct awareness sessions MVD prevention with printed visual that are sensitive to marginalised groups/languages/people\nwith an handicap.\n4. Community engagement and Accountability\nCEA interventions will serve across the sectors to inform a more relevant intervention, informed by communities feedback.\nThe first main pillar of the CEA actions will be to have in place an RCCE strategy using community dialogues, radio messaging, and house-\nto-house sensitization to promote preventive behaviors, safe caregiving, and dignified burial practices, while engaging community and\nreligious leaders to ensure local ownership. As part of the dialogue and direct two-way communication channels, ERCS will hold\nengagement meetings. While ensuring two-way feedback, the group meetings will especially target community influencers, community\nmembers, and lower-level private health facility workers, including drug shop and clinic operators, who are key observers of risk and\npractice as people seeking care will approach them first. The meetings will give opportunity for the branches to share the key messages of\nprevention and care seeking to these community influencers/representatives that will be spread faster to the wilder communities and\npromote practice and acceptance better. These groups meetings will also provide a space to hear from communities themselves what are\nthe key risks, rumors and belief but also the culturally appropriate approaches for the Risk communication. Considering trusted profile\nand are first line of contact for people that could have some suspicious symptom and are not directly going to health center.\nERCS will also establish real-time feedback channels to capture community concerns, rumors, and misinformation, and respond through\ntrusted community platforms while ensuring that marginalized and at-risk groups can provide feedback throughout the operation.\nTo support follow-up and ensure staff and volunteers remain reachable, ERCS will disseminate its toll-free line. Jointly with EPHI, ERCS\nwill conduct a KAP survey to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions, followed by a rapid qualitative assessment. During the\noperation, lessons and key highlights will be compiled, discussed, and shared with stakeholders through a lessons-learned workshop and\na video or written documentary. IFRC Africa Regional RCCE will support the ERCS RCCE lead in supervising deployed volunteers and\nparticipating in the RCCE pillar ahead of the deployment of an RCCE surge profile.\nPage 10 / 23\n\n5. National society operational support strengthening\nNational society health capacity will be reinforced through the deployment of surge specialists, recruitment of branch-level staff, and\ntraining of volunteers and RRTs in CBS, IPC, and PPE use. Health facilities will be supported with supplies and readiness assessments,\nwhile coordination capacity will be strengthened at regional and district levels through support to PHEM units and emergency platforms.\nSafety of staff and volunteers is at the center. Relevant technical and security briefings are included in this plan and some already\nengaged. There will also be adequate supervision, PPE provision, and psychosocial support to maintain wellbeing and operational\ncontinuity. all volunteers will be insured. As for the field, clear volunteers’ management sheet will be in place per zonal level to get the\nbest of each team, extensive coverage with all the mobilized volunteers and ensure well-being of the responders, NS will have a clear\ndivision of response team per pillars/ sector.\nFor streamlined involvement at various level, this operation support the NS with staffing at HQ and field level, to ensure smooth\nimplementation including PH/RCCE. PMER LoE, finance LoE, and project coordinator accountant at branch level. The technical profiles and\nsupprot services mobilised and dedicated to this intervention will ensure proper monitoring is in place qith effective tracking, data\ncollection and reporting. To ease the process, the DREF is also covering electronic materials and platform fees for a digitalized process,\nsmoother and easier to document.\n6. Secretariat services\nIFRC is supporting NS coordination efforts, donor engagement and compliance to response standards.\n• Activation and capitalisation on IFRC emnergency tools and task force. Through, IFRC Surge rooster, NS will leverage the expertise from\nneighboring countries previously responded to MVD to support ERCS, and strengthen the health capacity of Ethipian response teams.\nFrthermore, the IFRC IM unit of the Secretariat is ensuring screening, dissemination of information on the sub-regional dynamic,\nproviding an oversight of various risks of cases escalation, ensuring frequent information sharing.\n• The capacity from the preparedness for pandemic in the country set-up from the PREPARE project serves as a quick start for NS\npresence and response to this Outbreak. The PoE assessments, stakeholder mapping, CBS, RCCE, and EPIC, communication and\ncommunity engagement, infection prevention and control, coordination and leadership is being used to design the adequate support\nfrom secretariat despite the region being not in priority PoE, the capacity invested will be deployed to support this emergency response.\n• As for the field and technical support, the deployment of surge will streghten the profiles already in country. Both surges and IFRC staff\nwill ensure proper monitoring and quality assurance during this intervention. From planning, to implementation, ensuring minimum\nstandards are followed and safety of responders is priorities.\nA Detailed planning at field level will be implemented in parallel aligned to the stakeholders mapping to ensure we maximize the impact\nand keep a strong monitoring & reporting. The information and coordination with the regional task force of the secretariat will\ncontribute to the quality assurance and inform that detailed planning. Financial monitoring through regular spot0check and follow-up\nwill be done in parallel of technical and operational monitoring.\nTargeting Strategy\nWho will be targeted through this operation?\nThe operation will target both community and health system actors in and around Jinka Town, where suspected hemorrhagic fever cases\nhave been reported, with a focus on populations at highest risk of exposure and transmission.\nPrimary Target Groups\n1. Affected and At-Risk Communities:\nResidents of Jinka Town and surrounding kebeles will be the main focus, as they are at immediate risk due to proximity to suspected\ncases. Targeting these groups ensures early detection, effective risk communication, and adoption of preventive behaviors.\n2. Frontline Health Workers and Health Facilities:\nHealth professionals and facility staff in Jinka and neighboring districts will be prioritized for IPC training, PPE support, and readiness\nstrengthening to prevent nosocomial transmission and ensure safe case management.\n3. Community Health Volunteers and ERCS Branch Volunteers:\nThese groups will be trained and equipped to support community-based surveillance, contact tracing, and risk communication activities.\nTheir trusted presence in communities will facilitate rapid information flow and community compliance.\nPage 11 / 23\n\n4. Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) and PHEM Officers:\nStrengthening the capacity of local RRTs and public health emergency management staff will enhance outbreak detection, investigation,\nand coordination with national authorities.\n5. Vulnerable and Hard-to-Reach Populations\nSpecial attention will be given to mobile and cross-border populations, including migrants, pastoralists, and refugees living or transiting\nthrough Jinka and nearby areas. Children in schools, where they stay on close contact, with limited knowledge or risk measures. These\ngroups face higher exposure risks due to mobility, limited access to WASH and health services, and language or cultural barriers.\nTargeting will be achieved through:\nDeployment of Red Cross volunteers familiar with local languages and mobility patterns. Tailored communication and outreach using\nmobile awareness teams and culturally adapted IEC materials. Coordination with local authorities and humanitarian partners to ensure\ninclusion of refugee and migrant communities in surveillance, contact tracing, and RCCE efforts.\nTargeting Logic\nThe targeting strategy follows a risk-based approach, prioritizing groups most likely to be affected, to transmit infection, or to play a\ncritical role in containment. By addressing both the source (infected areas and at-risk populations) and the response capacity (health\nworkers and surveillance teams), the operation ensures comprehensive coverage and effective containment.\nExplain the selection criteria for the targeted population\nSelection Criteria for the Targeted Population\nThe operation will target general public while specific groups will be guided by risk-based and vulnerability-focused approach, ensuring\nthat those most exposed to the hemorrhagic fever and those critical to outbreak control are prioritized.\nCriteria for Targeting\n1. Proximity to Suspected Cases:\nCommunities residing in Jinka Town and surrounding kebeles are prioritized due to their immediate exposure risk. The rationale is that\nthese populations are the first potential recipients of infection; targeting them enables early case detection, effective health messaging,\nand adoption of preventive behaviors.\n2. Role in Health System and Response:\nFrontline health workers, facility staff, Rapid Response Teams (RRTs), and PHEM officers are selected based on their direct involvement in\ncase management, surveillance, and outbreak containment. Strengthening their capacity reduces the risk of nosocomial transmission and\nensures a rapid, organized response.\n3. Community Influence and Access:\nCommunity health volunteers and ERCS branch volunteers are targeted because of their trusted position in communities. Their ability to\nfacilitate surveillance, contact tracing, and RCCE ensures that health interventions reach households efficiently and that information flows\nquickly to authorities.\n4. Vulnerability and Access Barriers:\nMobile and cross-border populations including migrants, pastoralists, and refugees—are prioritized due to higher exposure risks, limited\naccess to health services, and potential language or cultural barriers. Selection considers mobility patterns, settlement areas, and\nconnectivity with health systems.\nRationale and Logic\nThe targeting logic integrates risk exposure, functional role, and vulnerability: Risk Exposure: Populations in immediate proximity to\nsuspected cases are more likely to contract and spread the infection.\nFunctional Role: Health workers and surveillance actors are critical for containment; their protection and capacity directly influence\noutbreak control effectiveness.\nPage 12 / 23\n\nVulnerability: Mobile, marginalized, or hard-to-reach groups face structural barriers to accessing health information and services, making\ntargeted interventions essential for equitable protection.\nTotal Targeted Population\nGirls (under 18) - Urban 80%\nMen 280,770 People with disabilities (estimated) 10%\nBoys (under 18) -\nTotal targeted population 573,000\nRisk and Security Considerations (including\n\"management\")\nDoes your National Society have anti-fraud and corruption Yes\npolicy?\nDoes your National Society have prevention of sexual Yes\nexploitation and abuse policy?\nDoes your National Society have child protection/child No\nsafeguarding policy?\nDoes your National Society have whistleblower protection policy?

As of 26 November 2025, 78 laboratory tests have been conducted, of which twelve confirmed cases, including seven confirmed deaths, have been reported, three cases remain probable. Of the twelve confirmed cases, five are currently alive, three on treatment, and two discharged. More than 300 contacts have been identified and are under active follow-up. Given the high fatality potential and rapid transmissibility of Marburg, (MVD) an immediate and coordinated public health response is essential. Early detection, isolation, contact tracing, and community sensitization are critical to prevent further spread by strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) in health facilities, ensuring the safety of health workers, mobilizing rapid response teams (RRTs), and effective risk communication are key priorities at this stage.</p>\n<p>An urgent response is warranted due to the potential for rapid local and cross-regional transmission, and significant public health threat associated with hemorrhagic fevers. Delayed intervention could result in high morbidity and mortality, community panic and overburdening of the health system. Immediate action will help contain the outbreak source, interrupt transmission chains, and protect both the affected population and health workers while laboratory confirmation and epidemiological investigations continue.</p>\n"

Immediate strengthening of the case-management and\ninfection-prevention pillars are critical, including the standardization of the Marburg treatment center, the improvement of\nIPC measures, the establishment of screening and referral units at peripheral health facilities and the continuation of basic\nhealth services. Additionally, the procurement of appropriate supplies—including personal protective equipment, IPC\nequipment and WASH supplies—is vital, as is ensuring sufficient staff capacity to conduct key training and to respond to\nthe outbreak.",

      "body_text": "<p><strong>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 26 January 2026 –</strong> The first-ever outbreak of Marburg in Ethiopia has been declared over, after less than three months of rapid and collaborative response efforts supported by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).</p>\n<p>The end of the outbreak – which was largely confined to Ethiopia’s southern region – comes after 42 consecutive days without any new cases. Africa CDC Director-General, Dr Jean Kaseya, commended the Government of Ethiopia for its swift leadership and high level of transparency throughout the response, noting that the country’s actions demonstrated the resilience and growing strength of its health system.</p>\n<p>He said rather than allowing the emergency to disrupt essential services, Ethiopia adopted an integrated approach that paired routine vaccination campaigns with door‑to‑door screening in affected communities. “This community‑centred strategy ensured early detection, maintained public confidence and preserved continuity of care,” Dr Kaseya said.</p>\n<p>A robust laboratory system also played a central role in the response. More than 3,800 tests were conducted, leading to 14 confirmed cases, nine deaths and five recoveries. This emphasis on timely, high-quality data allowed authorities to guide decisions with precision and confidence, according to Dr Kaseya.</p>\n<p>He said Ethiopia informed Africa CDC immediately upon confirmation of laboratory results on 14 November 2025, even before the formal outbreak declaration, describing this as “a powerful sign of trust and a strong commitment to continental health security.”</p>\n<p>Dr Mekdes Daba, Ethiopia’s Health Minister, said the swift containment of the outbreak underscores strong national leadership, effective coordination and the dedication of frontline teams and communities, while emphasising that continued preparedness is vital to safeguard populations against future health threats.</p>\n<p>From the start of the outbreak, Africa CDC worked closely with the Ministry of Health and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI). The agency deployed technical experts into Ethiopia’s Incident Management System, supported the development of the national Marburg response plan, and provided essential supplies, including more than 2,000 PCR testing kits and protective equipment for frontline health workers. The organisation also strengthened Ethiopia’s surveillance, rapid-response capacity and operational research to help prevent future outbreaks.</p>\n<p>However, Africa CDC’s partnership with Ethiopia goes beyond emergency response. More than USD 1,26 million in laboratory equipment has been provided to EPHI and the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, supporting the training of laboratory personnel, the improvement of testing infrastructure and the expansion of the country’s capacity to detect and respond to priority pathogens.</p>\n<p>Through an Africa CDC–led regional initiative with the World Bank, Ethiopia also secured USD 150 million for new laboratory and office infrastructure, which is currently under development. The EPHI has been designated an Africa CDC Regional Centre of Excellence and is advancing international partnerships, including with the Public Health Agency of Sweden.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Addis Ababa will host the 5th International Conference on Public Health in Africa (CPHIA 2026), showcasing Ethiopia’s modernised Public Health Emergency Operations Centre, Artificial Intelligence Centre and growing innovation ecosystem.</p>\n<p>“Today, as we celebrate the end of this outbreak, we are not only celebrating the containment of a virus,” Dr Kaseya said. “We are celebrating Ethiopian leadership that is positioning the Ethiopian Public Health Institute as a continental centre of excellence for outbreak preparedness and response.</p>\n<p>###</p>\n<p><strong>About Africa CDC</strong></p>\n<p>The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a public health agency of the African Union.

      "body_text": "<p>**Addis Ababa—** The Government of Ethiopia has officially declared the end of its first-ever outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD) following the completion of enhanced surveillance and the mandatory follow-up period, with no new confirmed cases reported for consecutive 42 days. The outbreak, first confirmed on 14 November 2025 in the South Ethiopia Region, was contained in less than three months through a swift, coordinated response led by the government and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>\n<p>From the onset of the outbreak, WHO worked in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) to support response efforts at national and sub-national levels. WHO Ethiopia played a pivotal role in coordinating response operations and providing sustained technical and operational support across all response pillars, including leadership and coordination, surveillance, laboratory, case management, infection prevention and control, logistics and risk communication and community engagement.</p>\n<p>A total of 14 confirmed cases were reported during the outbreak, including nine deaths and five recoveries. There were five deaths that were probable cases. The outbreak affected four districts—Jinka, Malle, and Arba Minch in the South Ethiopia Region and Hawassa in the Sidama Region—triggering the rapid activation and scale-up of response measures. These included active case detection, isolation and supportive care, comprehensive contact tracing, strengthened infection prevention and control in health facilities and engagement with affected communities.</p>\n<p>In total, 857 contacts were identified and monitored for 21 days. Three health workers were infected during the outbreak; two died and one recovered, highlighting both the severity of Marburg virus disease and the critical importance of infection prevention and control measures.</p>\n<p>WHO activated its emergency response mechanisms within 24 hours of outbreak confirmation in support of the government-led response. Within the same period, WHO deployed 36 experts to the affected areas and repurposed an additional 28 staff to reinforce field operations. The teams provided technical assistance across surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory diagnostics, case management, infection prevention and control, coordination and logistics.</p>\n<p>WHO also mobilized and delivered critical emergency supplies. These included laboratory testing supplies and equipment, viral haemorrhagic fever supplies, materials for the establishment and operation of treatment and isolation facilities and vehicles to support field mobility. These contributions enabled the rapid expansion of diagnostic capacity, strengthened patient care and supported effective outbreak control at the frontline. Ensuring the consistent application of standard Marburg virus disease response protocols was another core component of WHO’s support.</p>\n<p>“The rapid containment of this outbreak reflects strong national leadership, effective coordination, and the dedication of frontline responders and communities,” said Honourable Dr Mekdes Daba, Minister of Health. “Sustaining preparedness remains essential to protect the population from future public health threats.”</p>\n<p>The response was further enabled by Ethiopia’s prior investments in public health preparedness, including strengthened laboratory capacity, disease surveillance systems, a trained surge workforce and coordination through the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre. These capacities, supported through initiatives such as the Ethiopian Pandemic Multi-Sectoral Prevention, Preparedness and Response Project and the AVoHC-SURGE program, allowed for early detection, the scale-up of diagnostics, the deployment of responders and the continuity of essential health services.</p>\n<p>“WHO highly values the timely measures taken by the Ministry of Health and the Government of Ethiopia and remains committed to supporting national efforts to further strengthen capacities to prevent, detect and respond to future public health emergencies,” said Dr Francis Chisaka Kasolo, WHO Representative in Ethiopia. “Ethiopia’s response to the Marburg outbreak underscores the importance of sustained preparedness and effective coordination.”</p>\n<p>National authorities and partners are implementing follow-up programmes to support Marburg survivors as part of recovery efforts and preparedness planning. After-action reviews are also underway to capture lessons learned and further strengthen readiness for future outbreaks.</p>\n<p>“Preparedness saved time, and time saved lives,” said Dr Senait Tekeste Fekadu, WHO Incident Manager for the MVD response. “Ending this outbreak so quickly reflects a resilient health system strengthened through sustained capacity development, while reinforcing the need to continue investing in readiness.”</p>\n<p>Marburg virus disease is a severe and often fatal illness caused by the Marburg virus. It is transmitted to humans from fruit bats and spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or contaminated materials. Early supportive care improves survival. While no licensed vaccines or therapeutics are currently available, several candidates are undergoing clinical trials.</p>\n<p><strong>For Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:</strong></p>\n<p>FITA Yetenayet</p>\n<p>Communication officer<br />\nWHO Ethiopia<br />\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:yfita@who.int\">yfita@who.int</a></p>\n<p>Saida Swaleh</p>\n<p>Communications and Media Relations Officer<br />\nWHO Regional Office for Africa<br />\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:saida.swaleh@who.int\">saida.swaleh@who.int</a></p>\n"

      "body_text": "<p>On 26 January 2026, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared the end of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak. This declaration came after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) since the last person confirmed with MVD died and was given a safe and dignified burial, in accordance with WHO recommendations on 14 December 2025. As of 25 January 2026, a cumulative total of 19 cases, including 14 confirmed (including nine deaths) and five probable cases (all deaths), were reported. A total of 857 contacts listed for monitoring all had completed their 21-day follow-up as of 25 January 2026. WHO, through its country office and partners, provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak.</p>\n<p>On 14 November 2025, after the laboratory confirmation of suspected viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) cases in Jinka town, South Ethiopia Regional State, Ethiopia, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared an outbreak of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD). Molecular testing conducted by the National Reference Laboratory at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) identified Marburg virus (MARV) in patient samples. This was the first time Ethiopia was reporting a <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON585\">MVD outbreak</a>.</p>\n<p>The first known case was an adult from Jinka town who developed symptoms on 23 October. The patient presented to the General Hospital the following day with vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal cramps. As of 25 January 2026, a cumulative total of 14 confirmed cases, including nine deaths (Case Fatality Rate (CFR) 64.3%) and five probable cases, all of whom had died, were reported by the Ministry of Health from Jinka, Malle and Dasench woredas in South Ethiopia Region and Hawassa in Sidama Region.</p>\n<p>As of 25 January 2026, a total of 857 contacts were listed who completed 21 days of follow-up, 760 from the South Ethiopia Region and 97 from the Sidama Region. As of 5 January 2026, 3800 samples were tested for the virus.</p>\n<p>On 26 January 2026, after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days), without a new confirmed case reported, after the last confirmed case died and was given a safe and dignified burial, on 14 December 2025, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared the end of the MVD outbreak, as per WHO recommendations.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: Map of districts reporting confirmed and probable Marburg virus disease cases in Ethiopia, as of 25 January 2026</strong></p>\n<p>Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe disease caused by either of two closely related viruses, Marburg virus and Ravn virus. MVD has a high case fatality rate, ranging from 24% to 88% from previous outbreaks. The CFR can be lowered with early supportive patient care. The virus is initially transmitted to humans from fruit bats (<em>Rousettus aegyptiacus</em>) and then spreads among people through direct contact with bodily fluids, contaminated surfaces, or infected materials. Healthcare workers, caregivers, and individuals involved in burial practices are particularly at risk when appropriate infection, prevention and control measures are not in place.</p>\n<p>MVD symptoms typically begin abruptly after an incubation period of two to 21 days and include high fever, severe headache, malaise, muscle aches, and progressive gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. In severe cases, patients may experience bleeding from multiple sites and die from shock and organ failure within a week of symptom onset.</p>\n<p>There are no approved treatment or vaccines for MVD, although early supportive care improves survival. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.</p>\n<p>Nineteen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON552\">recent</a> outbreak was reported from the Republic of Tanzania between January and March 2025. Additional countries that have reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda.</p>\n<p>Local and national health authorities in Ethiopia implemented the following public health measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A National Taskforce established at the Ministry of Health to provide strategic guidance, make decisions and mobilize resources.</li>\n<li>A costed national three-month response plan developed and launched by the MoH/EPHI</li>\n<li>The MoH regularly disseminated information on the MVD outbreak to the public and key partners.</li>\n<li>Public Health Emergency Operational Centres were activated at national and regional levels, with incident management structures established to coordinate the response.</li>\n<li>The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with EPHI and regional health offices, conducted integrated surveillance and response activities, including at priority points of entry (PoEs) and points of control (PoCs).</li>\n<li>Community surveillance, contact tracing, house-to-house visits, and medical service delivery were enhanced.</li>\n<li>Two hospitals designated as treatment centres, with dedicated health workers deployed to manage cases.</li>\n<li>Laboratory capacities were strengthened both at national level and through the deployment of a mobile laboratory in Jinka for timely confirmation.</li>\n<li>Field assessments conducted by a rapid response team (RRT).</li>\n<li>Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) teams disseminated MVD prevention messages, conducted community dialogues, developed activity plans for targeted community interventions, monitored social media to address misinformation, and assessed trusted communication channels to enhance public awareness and engage local networks and influencers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WHO, through its country office and partners, provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WHO provided policy, technical and operational support across all response pillars, including on PoE surveillance, laboratory, case management, IPC, safe and dignified burial, RCCE, logistics and cross-border coordination.</li>\n<li>Provided emergency supplies including testing kits, VHF kits, treatment centre modules.</li>\n<li>Deployed technical experts to provide operational support across all response pillars.</li>\n<li>Provided technical support for capacity building and supervision on surveillance, integrated case management and IPC activities.</li>\n<li>Continued providing technical and strategic support for the transition plan, including the integration of the MVD response into essential health services.</li>\n<li>Supported the Regional Health Bureau (RHB) with community-based active case searching and mortality surveillance across various clusters.</li>\n<li>Provided technical and programmatic support to the RHB for the development and implementation of the Survivors Program.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This was the first-ever confirmed MVD outbreak reported in Ethiopia. Based on the outbreak investigation and surveillance activities during the response, which included contact tracing, alert management, active case search, and mortality surveillance, no additional cases have been reported during the 42-day countdown period, as per WHO recommendations. However, there remains a risk of re-emergence of MVD following the declaration of the end of the outbreak, with potential spillovers from interactions with the animal reservoir.</p>\n<p>Risk communication and community engagement activities will continue to provide timely and accurate information, monitor and address community feedback and rumours, while supporting efforts to reduce stigma toward individuals affected by the outbreak.</p>\n<p>WHO encourages maintaining early detection and care capacities in addition to sustaining the ability to quickly respond after the outbreak ends. This is to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities can detect it immediately, prevent the disease from spreading again, and ultimately save lives.</p>\n<p>Raising awareness of risk factors for MVD and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission in healthcare facilities and in communities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies. People visiting or working in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks).</li>\n<li>Capabilities for early detection of MVD patients should be maintained over time in settings at risk of the disease.</li>\n<li>Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with MVD patients should be avoided. Patients suspected or confirmed for MVD should be isolated in a designated treatment centre for early care and to avoid transmission at home.</li>\n<li>Communities affected by MVD, along with health authorities, should ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself and about necessary outbreak containment measures.</li>\n<li>Outbreak containment measures include safe and dignified burial of the deceased, identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with MVD and monitoring their health for 21 days and providing care to the confirmed patient. Any sick people with symptoms matching MVD should be referred to a health facility with adequate capacity.</li>\n<li>Critical infection prevention and control measures should be implemented and/or strengthened in all health care facilities, per <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WPE-CRS-HCR-2023.1\">WHO’s Infection prevention and control guideline for Ebola and Marburg disease</a>.

      "body_text": "<p>On 12 November 2025, WHO noted a press release from the Ethiopian Ministry of Health (MoH), and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), announcing suspected viral hemorrhagic viral fever (VHF) in Jinka town, South Ethiopia Regional State, Ethiopia. On 14 November 2025, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia confirmed that the cases previously reported as suspected VHF were Marburg virus disease (MVD). Molecular testing conducted by the National Reference Laboratory at EPHI identified Marburg virus (MARV) in patient samples. As of 20 November 2025, 33 laboratory tests have been conducted, of which six confirmed cases, including three deaths, have been reported. Of the six confirmed cases, three are currently alive and on treatment. In addition to the lab-confirmed cases, a further three epidemiologically linked cases could not be tested; all three are deceased and recorded as probable cases. A total of 206 contacts have been identified, and contacts are under active follow-up. The number of contacts will continue to change as the response evolves. The source of the infection has not yet been identified. This marks the first confirmed outbreak of MVD in the country. Initial investigation by the one health team in Ethiopia show the presence of the natural host of the virus, fruit bats, in the area. MVD is a severe, often fatal illness, transmitted from bats to humans, and clinically similar to Ebola virus diseases. The disease has a case fatality ratio of up to 88%, but it can be much lower with good and early patient care. Under the leadership of the MoH, WHO is working alongside the Ethiopian response teams to enhance coordination, surveillance (including outbreak investigation, contact tracing, and alert management), case management, infection prevention and control measures, laboratory capacity, risk communication and community engagement. WHO assesses the public health risk posed by the outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level. Ethiopia is facing concurrent emergencies and multiple disease outbreaks, including of cholera, measles, dengue, which results in stretched health capacity.</p>\n<p>As of 20 November 2025, 33 laboratory tests have been conducted, of which six confirmed cases, including three deaths, have been reported. Of the six confirmed cases, three are currently alive and on treatment. In addition to the lab-confirmed cases, a further three epidemiologically linked cases could not be tested; all three are deceased and recorded as probable cases. A total of 206 contacts have been identified, and contacts are under active follow-up. The number of contacts will continue to change as the response evolves.</p>\n<p>Clinically, patients have presented with high-grade fever, headache, vomiting, abdominal pain, and watery or bloody diarrhoea. Haemorrhagic manifestations, including nose bleeding and vomiting blood were observed in five cases, consistent with multi-organ failure.</p>\n<p>As this is the first time Ethiopia is reporting MVD, WHO recommends that samples be shared with a reference laboratory for inter-laboratory comparison.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: Map of Ethiopia showing location of Jinka town</strong></p>\n<p>Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe hemorrhagic fever caused by either of two closely related viruses, Marburg virus and Ravn virus, which are closely related to the Ebola viruses. MVD has a high case fatality rate, ranging from 24% to 88% from previous outbreaks The case fatality rate can be lowered with good and early patient care. The virus is initially transmitted to humans from fruit bats (<em>Rousettus aegyptiacus</em>) and then spreads among people through direct contact with bodily fluids, contaminated surfaces, or infected materials. Healthcare workers, caregivers, and individuals involved in burial practices are particularly at risk when infection prevention and control measures are not in place.</p>\n<p>MVD symptoms typically begin abruptly after an incubation period of two to 21 days and include high fever, severe headache, malaise, muscle aches, and progressive gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. In severe cases, patients may experience bleeding from multiple sites and die from shock and organ failure within a week of symptom onset.</p>\n<p>There are no approved treatment or vaccines for MVD, although supportive treatment and early supportive care improves survival. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.</p>\n<p>Nineteen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON552\">recent</a> outbreak was reported from the Republic of Tanzania between January and March 2025. Additional countries that have reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda.</p>\n<p>Local and national health authorities in Ethiopia have implemented the following public health measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A National Taskforce has been established at the Ministry of Health to provide strategic guidance, make decisions and mobilize resources.</li>\n<li>A costed national three-month response plan has been developed and launched by the MoH/EPHI.</li>\n<li>The MoH is regularly providing information on the MVD outbreak to the general public and partners.</li>\n<li>Emergency Operational Centres (EOCs) have been activated at national and regional levels, with incident management structures established to coordinate the response. Daily coordination meetings are ongoing at the national and subnational EOCs.</li>\n<li>The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with EPHI and regional health offices, is conducting integrated surveillance and response activities.</li>\n<li>Community surveillance, contact tracing, house-to-house visits, and medical service delivery are being enhanced.</li>\n<li>Two hospitals have been designated as treatment centres, with dedicated health workers deployed to manage cases.</li>\n<li>Field assessments are being conducted by a rapid response team (RRT). One RRT was deployed to Jinka to conduct contact tracing and epidemiological investigation while a second team is strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) in health facilities managing suspected cases.</li>\n<li>Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) teams are disseminating MVD prevention messages, developing activity plans for targeted interventions, monitoring social media to address misinformation, and assessing trusted communication channels to enhance public awareness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the first confirmed MVD outbreak in Ethiopia. The public health risk posed by the MVD outbreak is assessed as high at the national level due to several concerning factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The outbreak involves six laboratory-confirmed cases; there have been a total of six deaths and there are three confirmed cases under treatment.</li>\n<li>All deaths involved unsupervised burials, posing a risk of potential additional community transmission.</li>\n<li>The presence of healthcare workers among the confirmed cases suggests potential occupational exposure risks within health facilities.</li>\n<li>Although investigations are ongoing, information on the source of the outbreak, geographical extent and epidemiology is limited.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although no international transmission has been confirmed to date, the potential risk for spread remains. The affected area, Jinka, while distant from Ethiopia’s capital or major international airports, is connected by road transportation networks, including to neighbouring Kenya and South Sudan. Therefore, the public health risk posed by this event is assessed as moderate at the regional level. It is considered low at the global level.</p>\n<p>Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with the blood and/or other bodily fluids of infected people. Strengthening and reinforcing IPC measures is essential to prevent further transmission and reduce the likelihood of amplification.</p>\n<p>WHO advises the following risk reduction measures to be taken as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission to control the outbreak.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Protective measures individuals should take to reduce human exposure to the virus include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids including blood, feces and vomit. Close physical contact with MVD patients should be avoided.</li>\n<li>Persons with symptoms compatible with MVD should immediately seek care in health facilities, and patients suspected or confirmed to have MVD should be isolated in a designated treatment centre for early care and to avoid transmission at home.</li>\n<li>Community and family members should avoid caring for symptomatic individuals at home and avoid touching bodies of people deceased with MVD symptoms. They should avoid touching other potentially contaminated items and surfaces.</li>\n<li>Reduce the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines, caves or dwellings inhabited by fruit bat colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks). During outbreaks, all animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Coordination:</strong> Multisectoral coordination and pillar meetings at all levels and sharing of detailed situation reports is encouraged. Involvement of different stakeholders and partners in preparedness and response activities is also encouraged. To ensure an effective and sustained response, resource mobilization efforts within the government and with partners are recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk communication and community engagement:</strong> Raising public awareness and engaging with communities are important for successfully controlling MVD outbreaks. This includes raising awareness of symptoms, risk factors for infection, protective measures and the importance of seeking immediate care at a health facility. Sensitive and supportive information about safe and dignified burials is also crucial. This awareness should be increased through targeted campaigns and direct work with communities. Special attention should be given to high-risk groups, such as traditional healers, clergy, and community leaders, who may inadvertently facilitate disease spread, and who are important sources of information for the community. Misinformation and rumours should be addressed to foster trust and promote early symptom reporting.</p>\n<p><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Active case detection, contact tracing, and alert management across affected and neighbouring regions should be intensified. Community-based surveillance systems should be strengthened to promptly identify and report new cases, particularly in high-risk areas. Close monitoring of healthcare workers, family members and individuals who have had contact with suspected cases or other high-exposure settings should be ensured. Surveillance capacities should also be intensified at relevant points of entry and borders to reduce the risk of further spread, including internationally.</p>\n<p><strong>Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Critical infection prevention and control measures should be implemented and/or strengthened in all health care facilities, per <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WPE-CRS-HCR-2023.1\">WHO’s Infection prevention and control guideline for Ebola and Marburg disease</a>, which highlighted the importance of the rapid implementation of the IPC ring approach, including but not limited to IPC rapid assessment, decontamination of health facilities and households and early detection and identification of the cases through the screening and isolation of the suspected cases to minimize the transmission risk. Patients meeting the case definition for suspected MVD should be treated with appropriate precautions for MVD, regardless of whether the clinical suspicion suggests a more common ailment with similar symptoms, such as malaria.</li>\n<li>Health workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.2\">transmission-based precautions</a> in addition to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.1\">standard precautions</a>, including appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene according to the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/infection-prevention-and-control/your-5-moments-for-hand-hygiene-poster.pdf?sfvrsn=83e2fb0e_21%22%20%EF%B7%9FHYPERLINK%20%22https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/infection-prevention-and-control/your-5-moments-for-hand-hygiene-poster.pdf?sfvrsn=83e2fb0e_21\">WHO 5 moments</a>, to avoid contact with patient’s blood and other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects.

For details on recommendations and improvement, follow the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240043237\">WASH FIT implementation Package</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Laboratory testing:</strong> The processing and analysis of samples should be expedited, with results promptly shared with responders and clinicians to guide patient management, containment strategies and broader response efforts. This includes genomic sequencing on positive samples. International referral of samples to a regional reference laboratory should be considered for inter-laboratory comparison. Laboratory workers handling specimens from patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MARV should receive refresher training on laboratory biosafety; this includes taking appropriate precautions when drawing blood for a malaria rapid diagnostic test or other test not specific for MARV.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation of candidate medical countermeasures:</strong> There are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics against MVD. Several candidate vaccines are in the pipeline and outbreaks offer an opportunity to assess their efficacy and safety. There are <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/blueprint/ebolavirus\">protocols available</a> and a network of experts in filoviruses ready to support national researchers.</p>\n<p><strong>Safe and dignified burials:</strong> Safe and dignified burial protocols should be implemented for persons who have died to minimize community exposure. Additional training and equipment for healthcare workers and burial teams should be provided to ensure safe management of MVD-related fatalities. Thorough community engagement is required to ensure that affected communities are empowered to adhere to the protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Case management and mental health and psychosocial support:</strong> Designated treatment centers should ensure adequate level of care for confirmed patients to improve the chance of survival. Isolation and treatment facilities should be adequately equipped to ensure the safety and efficacy of patient care, while simultaneously preventing the spread of the disease. Supportive care such as rehydration, symptom management, and psychological support for patients and their families is essential to improving survival rates and mitigating the outbreak's impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Border health and cross-border coordination:</strong> Surveillance capacities should be strengthened at relevant at-risk points of entry, onboard conveyances, and in border regions to prevent further spread, including internationally. Cases, contacts and individuals in affected areas who present signs and symptoms compatible with case definition should be advised not to travel, in line with WHO’s border health and points of entry technical guidance for filovirus disease outbreaks. Collaboration with neighbouring countries should be enhanced to harmonize reporting mechanisms, conduct joint investigations, and share critical data in real-time. Countries at-risk of potential spread should enhance readiness activities to enable early case detection, isolation and treatment.</p>\n<p>Based on the current risk assessment, WHO advises against any travel and trade restrictions with Ethiopia.</p>\n<p><strong>Citable reference:</strong> World Health Organization (21 November 2025).

              "OCTOBER TO DECEMBER (OND) CLIMATE REVIEW\n• Rainfall: Mixed performance with substantial deficits in central Somalia and\nnortheastern Kenya, as predicted. Wetter-than-usual conditions were observed in\nRwanda, northern Uganda, southern South Sudan, western Kenya, and northern\nTanzania. However, the seasonal rainfall was erratic, with dry spells and intense\nrainfall, particularly in northeast Kenya, negatively affecting crops and rangeland.\nSince Dec, the region has been generally dry. Latest updates (1st week Feb)\nindicate rain deficit with some areas experiencing dry soil (Fig1) in southwestern\nUganda and western/southeastern Tanzania, making these areas more vulnerable\nto severe flooding if heavy rain occurs (see Drought-Flood Cycle below). No\nmajor flooding between Dec-Feb, as La Niña led to a drier conditions.\n• Temperature: OND is not a strong heat season for most of the countries in the\nregion. However, warmer than usual conditions were observed over the region\n(Copernicus) as predicted in the forecasts.\n• Food insecurity: Poor cropping and vegetation condition were found across most\nof Somalia, eastern Ethiopia, Northern Kenya and northern Sudan. Surface water\ndepletion was reported in northern Kenya and several points in ‘watch’ situation\nFig 1. ICPAC Drought Watch, Feb Week #1.\nin South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia.\n• Health: There have been many protracted cholera outbreaks over recent months, ongoing from the region wide outbreaks of 2023/24, with\n>10K cases in South Sudan, >2K cases in Sudan and hundreds reported in Somalia and Uganda in January 2025 alone [WHO]. M-pox has\ncontinued to spread from DRC, Burundi and Uganda to South Sudan and there have been a small number of cases of Ebola (Sudan Virus) in\nUganda and Marburg recently in Tanzania. Dengue cases have been reported in Sudan [AfricaCDC] and measles in Ethiopia and Kenya.\n• Conflicts and displacement: During OND 2023, heavy rains and flooding displaced thousands across Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia,\nEthiopia and Tanzania [UN-IOM]. Over the 2024 OND season, hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Sudan conflict arrived in\nneighbouring countries, and internal displacement rose especially in South Sudan due to floods. In January, 24,885 people were displaced in\nNasir County and Abyei Administrative Area, with 56% women and girls. Most displacements (21,385) were in Nasir County due to food\ninsecurity and fires, while 3,500 people were displaced in Abyei AA by fires [IOM-DTM].",

              "EXPECTED IMPACTS\nStagnant floodwater affects health in various ways in Eastern Africa. Despite this MAM season indicating below normal rainfall in the\nregion, the most prevalent diseases expected are mainly malaria, cholera and other waterborne diseases (Reliefweb). In SSD, floods are\nalso known to spread pollution from oil, war debris and dead animals across the region, affecting the health of communities, as well as\nthe livelihoods and nutritional status of pastoralist communities, as cattle sicken, and agriculture is made more difficult. Rec: Flood\nresponses, WASH, vaccination, Malaria prevention, collaborative with VSF for active cattle RVF surveillance.\nTemperatures. The GHA is expected to experience above-average temperatures during the MAM season especially in Sudan, Ethiopia,\nNorthern Somalia and parts of Tanzania (southeast) and Kenya (north). This will worsen already very hot conditions during this season in\nSouth Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, and northern Kenya, and bring some unexpected hotter days in countries where heat is usually less\nprominent during this season, such as Tanzania or Ethiopia. This is may reduce crop yields and increase heat stress among vulnerable\ncommunities (GHHIN) Rec.: ICPAC weekly heat forecasts, ensure supply cold-chain, monitor vulnerable groups.\nAir pollution, particle matter (PM) and Wildfires. Air PM levels are above the WHO safety limit (15µg/m³) across the region, except for\nsouthern Somalia and Tanzania. Pollution is usually lower during the MAM season, except in Sudan and South Sudan, where it rises from\nFeb-May and peaks in March. March marks the end of the wildfire season, except for Tanzania which is the middle of the low season (Dec-\nMay) and South Sudan, where the wildfire season extends to April/May. Rec: Monitor IQAIR (real-time) or Windy (5-day forecast).\nDrought and drier than normal conditions are expected over the MAM season on the eastern part of the GHA. These conditions can\ncontribute to famine, increased malnutrition cases, reduced water quality, and to dust storms and meningitis outbreaks. With some areas\nforecasted to see below average rains, risk may persist longer than usual (Jaca et al, AfricaCDC, WHO). Rec.: monitor ICPAC Drought Watch\nLa Niña is a phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) characterized by a cooling of the tropical Pacific ocean. It impacts vulnerable\ncommunities with extreme weather events such as increased droughts, floods and storms on other regions. This phase is however\nexpected to diminish by April, transitioning to neutral conditions afterwards (FAO). Rec.: monitor ENSO forecast.\nInfectious diseases: With the USAID freeze leaving many people living with HIV unable to access antiretrovirals, opportunistic infections\nmay increase over 2025. Mpox cases are reducing in Uganda with vaccinations ongoing [WHO] but cases have been reported in South\nSudan. Malaria cases have been above average in parts of South Sudan and are projected to rise further in 2025 in some states [WHO].\nAcross \"meningitis belt“ countries, the peak season is ending, however due to dryer than usual conditions in the eastern GHA region, risk\nmay remain above usual for MAM. Rec: WHO Meningitis weekly bulletin and Dashboard, and the meningitis/dust alerts by ACMAD.\nFood insecurity: Food insecurity and malnutrition are expected to remain critical across the GHA, driven by conflict, economic pressure\nand climate shocks, especially in Sudan and South Sudan. Ongoing conflict in Sudan and the worsening crisis in South Sudan, including\nincreased flooding, will worsen food security. Below-average rainfall during MAM season will worsen food insecurity in Somalia, eastern\nKenya, and parts of Ethiopia. Uganda's refugee-hosting districts are also facing growing food insecurity, particularly in the west. Agriculture\nin Northeastern Kenya is at risk due to high temperatures and low rainfall. As FEWSNET is down, please check IPC for forecasts.\nPests: Locust are expected to decline in the Red Sea but increase in northern Sudan and Southern Egypt, where breeding will start soon.\nIn Somalia, no significant developments are likely.

Higher temperatures are common between\nMay-Sep, with more hot days (>35°C). Humid heat (temperature and humidity combined) is highest in April. Following the hot and dry Jilal season, the\nupcoming Gu season is forecasted to be drier and hotter than usual, undermining agriculture, water availability, displacement, food insecurity and\nadditional health crises (SWALIM). Health: Given the anticipated reduced rainfall for MAM, malnutrition is expected to increase especially in children,\nwater-borne diseases may rise due to unavailability of WASH, alongside heat-related illnesses (SWALIM). Nutrition: Malnutrition is likely to increase with\nthe La Niña-induced drought conditions, high food prices, limited stocks, high shipping costs and ongoing conflict and insecurity in central, parts of\nnorthwest and southern Somalia (IPC). Pests: Minimal locust activity observed, and very low numbers of solitary adults may persist along the northwest\ncoast and there is a low chance of forecasted swams/outbreaks for March-May.

Whilst staying at home can help them stay cool, this has\nnegative impacts on their education, development and general wellbeing. Across December to February, the country\nexperienced a very hot and dry period, which is likely to be followed mostly by above average rainfall over March to\nMay, especially in the East. In 2024, seasonal flooding displaced hundreds of thousands of people and livestock and\ndestroyed crops (IRC). Water levels have not receded as much as usual, and are unseasonally high for early March in\nmany places. This increases the risk of more significant flooding in areas forecasted for heavy MAM rainfall (ICPAC,\nFEWSNET). Health: Cholera cases are still ongoing since the outbreak in late 2024, although in most areas cases are\nreducing. An m-pox outbreak was declared in Juba in February this year, and the Ministry of Health alongside WHO\naddressing it (WHO). With the expected above normal rainfall over the eastern parts of the country, we anticipate\nincreased cases of cholera, malaria and measles, including extreme heat related cases (WHO, Humanitarian Action).\nThe meningitis dry season is coming to an end. Nutrition: High levels of food insecurity over the past few months may\nincrease acute malnutrition by 26% compared to 2024, primarily among children and pregnant and lactation women\n(Humanitarian Action). Floods spread pollution from oil, war debris, and dead animals, contaminating water and\nFig 5. South Sudan historical\nharming both human and cattle health.

              "Climate: Following the recent dry period of Dec-Feb, most of Ethiopia will likely experience below normal rainfall, with\ndrier than usual conditions during the March – May Belg rainy season increasing the risk of drought. The Gu/Genna\nrains in eastern Ethiopia are likely to be below average. The western parts bordering South Sudan may experience\nwetter conditions, favouring agriculture and pastoralism. This may however be impacted by high temperatures which\nwill increase evaporation rates and bring about heat stress (ICPAC). Most areas will have less than a week of\ntemperatures above 35°C annually, except in the northwest and Afar, where temperatures will rise in MAM and exceed\n35°C for over two weeks each month from April to October. Health: The ongoing conflict in the Amhara and Oromia\nregions is severely affecting public health, with increased violence and barriers to accessing health services,\ncomplicating the response to outbreaks like cholera, measles, and malaria. With at least 10 earthquakes recently\nreported in Ethiopia and signs of possible volcanic activity evacuations have begun for approximately 80K people in\nAfar, Oromia and Amhara. Access restrictions imposed by local militia prevent population’s access to health and relief\nservices. Flooding will likely affect areas such as Gambella, damaging healthcare facilities, affecting WASH\ninfrastructure, increasing malaria cases and also affect crop and animal rearing in areas with poor rainfall patterns\n(ICPAC). Nutrition: In areas where there will be improved water supply - in the western parts of the country during\nMarch-May, livestock health may improve which will further enhance nutrition and income generation for pastoralists.\nHowever, in the central and east part of the country, crop failures, water and pasture shortages may lead to a decline in\nFFiigg 66..

              "Climate: Following the below-average rainfall in most parts of the country on the previous season, MAM forecast indicates a higher likelihood of above\naverage rainfall over western and southern parts of Kenya, exceeding 200mm across the season, with below average rainfall across central and coastal\nparts (ICPAC). The northern and eastern parts of the country are expected to have below average rainfall (KMD). In northern Kenya, peak temperatures\nand hot days occur from January to May, with humid heat highest from March to April. Heat stress is expected to increase due to above-average\ntemperatures forecasted for MAM. Southeastern and coastal Kenya will experience lower temperatures and fewer hot days, with conditions forecasted to\nremain normal. Health: With expected floods and stagnating water over localized areas during the MAM season, we expect waterborne and vector borne\ndiseases to increase slightly mainly due to poor water and sanitation facilities. Heat stress on the other hand may be prominent in below average areas of\nnorthern and eastern parts, with increased respiratory infections (KMD). Nutrition: Even though the country has made progress in reducing malnutrition, it\nremains a concern in arid and semi-arid counties common with recurrent drought, less rainfall and limited access to healthcare, mostly affecting children\nunder 5, pregnant and lactating women (KMD, MOH). Pests: Whereas MAM rainfall may provide benefits for some regions, certain areas affected by\nreduced/increased rainfall and moisture content will encourage internal and external parasites and Transboundary Animal Diseases amidst conflict for\npasture and water among human, wildlife and livestock (ICPAC).
